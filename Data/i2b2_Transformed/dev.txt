1) O
INFECTIOUS O
DISEASE O
/ O
CELLULITIS O
: O

The B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
clinical I-SYMPTOM
situation I-SYMPTOM
was O
most O
consistent O
with O
a B-SYMPTOM
Pseudomonas I-SYMPTOM
cellulitis I-SYMPTOM
and O
subsequent B-SYMPTOM
sepsis I-SYMPTOM
. O

Blood O
cultures O
drawn O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
grew O
out O
Pseudomonas B-SYMPTOM
that O
was O
sensitive O
to O
Imipenem B-TREATMENT
and O
Tobramycin B-TREATMENT
. O

There O
were O
cultures O
obtained O
seeping O
from O
the B-SYMPTOM
wound I-SYMPTOM
at O
Retelk O
County O
Medical O
Center O
and O
those O
also O
grew O
out O
Pseudomonas B-SYMPTOM
aeruginosa I-SYMPTOM
. O

The B-SYMPTOM
organism I-SYMPTOM
grown O
at O
this O
institution O
was O
sensitive O
to O
Imipenem B-TREATMENT
, O
Ceftazidime B-TREATMENT
, O
Amikacin B-TREATMENT
, O
gentamicin B-TREATMENT
, O
Ciprofloxacin B-TREATMENT
, O
Tobramycin B-TREATMENT
but O

, O
Ceftriaxone B-TREATMENT
, O
Mezlocillin B-TREATMENT
, O
Bactrim B-TREATMENT
, O
Ampicillin B-TREATMENT
, O
chloramphenicol B-TREATMENT
, O
and O
sulbactam B-TREATMENT
. O

He O
was O
treated O
initially O
with O
Ceftazidime B-TREATMENT
and O
gentamicin B-TREATMENT
but O
there O
was O
a O
question O
about O
the B-SYMPTOM
organism I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
susceptibility I-SYMPTOM
from O
lab O
studies O
done O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
. O

He O
was O
subsequently O
switched O
to O
Imipenem B-TREATMENT
and O
Tobramycin B-TREATMENT
and O
was O
maintained O
on O
those B-TREATMENT
medications I-TREATMENT
throughout O
the O
hospital O
course O
. O

The B-TREATMENT
Tobramycin I-TREATMENT
and O
Imipenem B-TREATMENT
were O
started O
on O
11/25/94 O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
received O
a O
five O
day O
course O
of O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
IgG I-TREATMENT
to O
improve O
infection B-TREATMENT
control I-TREATMENT
. O

Vancomycin B-TREATMENT
was O
also O
added O
to O
his B-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
on O
11/28/94 O
and O
this O
was O
primarily O
to O
provide O
improved B-TREATMENT
MRSA I-TREATMENT
coverage I-TREATMENT
as O
he O
continued O
to O
have O
erythema B-SYMPTOM
along I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
lateral I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
lower I-SYMPTOM
extremity I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
Surgery O
Department O

feeling O
that O
there O
is O
no O
indication O
for O
surgical B-TREATMENT
intervention I-TREATMENT
/ O
amputation B-TREATMENT
at O
this O
time O
. O

He O
is O
being O
maintained O
with O
twice O
daily O
Xeroform B-TREATMENT
with O
Betadine B-TREATMENT
changes O
. O

These B-TREATMENT
dressing I-TREATMENT
changes I-TREATMENT
are O
applied O
by O
applying O
the O
Xeroform B-TREATMENT
on O
Betadine B-TREATMENT
initially O
and O
then O
changing O
it O
with O
sterile B-TREATMENT
dry I-TREATMENT
bandages I-TREATMENT
. O

Of O
note O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
extreme B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
with O
these B-TREATMENT
dressing I-TREATMENT
changes I-TREATMENT
and O
requires O
parenteral B-TREATMENT
morphine I-TREATMENT
sulfate I-TREATMENT
for O
pain B-SYMPTOM
control I-SYMPTOM
during I-SYMPTOM
dressing I-SYMPTOM
changes I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
complete O
a O
full O
course O
of O
Imipenem B-TREATMENT
and O
Tobramycin B-TREATMENT
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
Pseudomonas I-SYMPTOM
cellulitis I-SYMPTOM
. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
erythema B-SYMPTOM
tracking O
up O
his O
leg O
and O
up O
to O
his O
lateral O
thigh O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
this B-SYMPTOM
erythema I-SYMPTOM
is O
not O
know O
at O
this O
time O
but O
has O
not O
shown O
extensive O
progression O
. O

2) O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
initially O
treated O
with O
Dopamine B-TREATMENT
which O
was O
subsequently O
weaned O
off O
after O
his B-SYMPTOM
sepsis I-SYMPTOM
improved O
. O

He O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
in O
rapid B-SYMPTOM
AF I-SYMPTOM
on O
several O
episodes O
receiving O
5 B-TREATMENT
mg I-TREATMENT
IV I-TREATMENT
Lopressor I-TREATMENT
each O
time O
with O

. O

He O
has O
been O
in O
and O
out O
of O
atrial B-SYMPTOM
fibrillation I-SYMPTOM
and O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
performed O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
while O
he O
was O
septic B-SYMPTOM
showed O
decreased B-SYMPTOM
global I-SYMPTOM
EF I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
is O
being O
maintained O
on O
Digoxin B-TREATMENT
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
paroxysmal I-SYMPTOM
atrial I-SYMPTOM
fibrillation I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
has O
had O
no O
significant O
episode O
of O
tachycardia B-SYMPTOM
or O
blood B-SYMPTOM
pressure I-SYMPTOM
alteration I-SYMPTOM
during O
the O
final O
days O
of O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
plan O
is O
to O
continue O
the B-TREATMENT
Digoxin I-TREATMENT
and O
to O
recheck O
an O
echocardiogram O
to O
assess O
his O
ejection O
fraction O
when O
he O
is O
clinically O
better O
. O

3) O
ONCOLOGY O
: O

The O
patient O

. O

He O
has O
been O
receiving O
radiation B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
to O
that O
area O
during O
the O
hospital O

course O
of O
XRT B-TREATMENT
to I-TREATMENT
the I-TREATMENT
spinal I-TREATMENT
region I-TREATMENT
for O
the B-SYMPTOM
plasmacytoma I-SYMPTOM
. O

The B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
lesion I-SYMPTOM
compressing O
his O
thoracic O
spine O
was O
never O
biopsied O
, O
however O
, O
the O
MRI O
appearance O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
infectious B-SYMPTOM
and O
is O
most O
consistent O
with O
plasmacytoma B-SYMPTOM
for O
which O
he O
is O
receiving O
the B-TREATMENT
radiation I-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
. O

4) O
NEUROLOGIC O
: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
he O
has O
a B-SYMPTOM

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
work-up O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
cholestatic I-SYMPTOM
jaundice I-SYMPTOM
picture I-SYMPTOM
along O
with O
work-up O
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
and O
treatment B-TREATMENT
of O
both O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
pulmonary O
function O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
one O
possibility O
was O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
a B-SYMPTOM
Bactrim I-SYMPTOM
failure I-SYMPTOM
for O
PCP B-SYMPTOM
although O
this O
was O
unusual O
. O

He O
was O
started O
on O
Pentamidine B-TREATMENT
, O
especially O
in O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
liver O
function O
tests O
were O
due O
possibly O
to O
Bactrim B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
covered O
with O
Erythromycin B-TREATMENT
and O
Gentamicin B-TREATMENT
for O
coverage O
of O
community B-SYMPTOM
acquired I-SYMPTOM
pneumonias I-SYMPTOM
and O
gram B-SYMPTOM
negative I-SYMPTOM
rods I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
given O
supplemental B-TREATMENT
oxygen I-TREATMENT
. O

In O
terms O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
liver I-SYMPTOM
abnormalities I-SYMPTOM
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
viral B-SYMPTOM
hepatitis I-SYMPTOM
was O
in O
the O
differential O
as O
well O
as O
several B-SYMPTOM
opportunistic I-SYMPTOM
infections I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
liver I-SYMPTOM
but O
also O
was O
felt O
that O
Bactrim B-TREATMENT
could O
be O
a O
cause O
of O
these B-SYMPTOM
abnormalities I-SYMPTOM
. O

Titers O
for O
CMV B-SYMPTOM
and O
Epstein-Barr B-SYMPTOM
virus I-SYMPTOM
were O
sent O
and O
a O
titer O
for O
toxoplasma B-SYMPTOM
was O
sent O
. O

Stool O
was O
sent O
for O
ova B-SYMPTOM
and O
parasites B-SYMPTOM
. O

Gastrointestinal O
was O
consulted O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
well O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
pre-status O
and O
required O
less O
oxygen B-TREATMENT
. O

However O
, O
on O
02/10/91 O
, O
his O
respiratory O
rate O
increased O
and O
his O
oxygen O
saturation O
decreased O
. O

Actually O
in O
reviewing O
the O
records O
at O
this O
point O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
Pentamidine B-TREATMENT
was O
not O
started O
initially O
so O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
of O
Erythromycin B-TREATMENT
and O
Gentamicin B-TREATMENT
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
respiratory O
status O
worsened O
and O
his O
LDH O
climbed O
so O
he O
began O
Pentamidine B-TREATMENT
on O
02/10/91 O
. O

On O
02/11/91 O
, O
the O
patient O
again O
appeared O
more O
comfortable O
this O
time O
with O
50% B-TREATMENT
facemask I-TREATMENT
but O
then O
required O
more O
oxygen B-TREATMENT
, O
dropped O
his O
O2 O
saturations O
, O
and O
was O
intubated O
on O
02/11/91 O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
on O
12/12/90 O
on O
Gentamicin B-TREATMENT
, O
Vancomycin B-TREATMENT
, O
Pentamidine B-TREATMENT
, O
and O
Prednisone B-TREATMENT
. O

Also O
of O
note O
at O
that O
point O
, O
hepatitis O
C O
virus O
serologies O
had O
come O
back O
positive O
. O

However O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
his B-SYMPTOM
liver I-SYMPTOM
function I-SYMPTOM
test I-SYMPTOM
abnormalities I-SYMPTOM
appeared O
more O
consistent O
with O
a B-SYMPTOM
cholestatic I-SYMPTOM
picture I-SYMPTOM
with O
his O
direct O
bilirubin O
being O
12.1 O
and O
total O
being O
14.1 O
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
showed O
no O
liver B-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
and O
no O
obstruction B-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
liver O
function O
tests O
appeared O
to O
improve O
. O

The B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
penile I-SYMPTOM
ulcer I-SYMPTOM
was O
cultured O
and O
grew O
positive B-SYMPTOM
herpes I-SYMPTOM
simplex I-SYMPTOM
virus I-SYMPTOM
and O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
Acyclovir B-TREATMENT
. O

On O
02/13/91 O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
bronchoalveolar O
lavage O
performed O
which O
showed O
a B-SYMPTOM
toluidine I-SYMPTOM
blue I-SYMPTOM
with O
many B-SYMPTOM
pneumocysts I-SYMPTOM
noted O
. O

No O
other O
cultures O
grew O
out O
and O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
clinical O
status O
deteriorated O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
100% B-TREATMENT
oxygen I-TREATMENT
to O
maintain O
adequate O
oxygen O
saturations O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
ventilator I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
required O
elevated B-TREATMENT
ventilatory I-TREATMENT
pressures I-TREATMENT
with O
PIPS O
often O
above O
60 O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
no O
evidence O
of O
baratroma B-SYMPTOM
was O
ever O
discerned O
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
respiratory O
status O
continued O
to O
decline O
and O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
maintain O
oxygen O
saturations O
above O
80% O
even O
using O
reverse B-TREATMENT

ventilation I-TREATMENT
, O

, O
and O
other B-TREATMENT
modes I-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
ventilation I-TREATMENT
. O

Patient O
underwent O
liver O
biopsy O
on O
02/16/91 O
and O
the O
results O
of O
this O
were O
pending O
when O
the O
patient O
died O
. O

The O
patient O
actually O
developed O
decreasing B-SYMPTOM

with O
white O

as O
low O
as O
1.75 O

and O

noted O
on O
02/15/91 O
. O

These O
were O
supported O
with O
blood B-TREATMENT
products I-TREATMENT
and O
Hematology O
was O
consulted O
. O

They O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
secondary O
to O
Bactrim B-TREATMENT
and O
these O
actually O
were O
getting O
better O
when O
the O
patient O
died O
. O

Bone O

not O
attempted O
. O

Discussions O
were O
begun O
with O
the O
family O
regarding O
limits O
of O
supportive B-TREATMENT
care I-TREATMENT
. O

Due O
to O
continued B-SYMPTOM
worsening I-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
status I-SYMPTOM
and O
an O
overall O
grim O
prognosis O
, O
the O
family O
decided O
, O
in O
consultation O
with O
the O
Medical O
Team O
, O
to O
withdraw O
ventilatory B-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
. O

This O
was O
done O
on O
the O

The O
patient O

, O
500 O
red O

with O
82 O
polyps O
, O
11 O
lymphs O
, O
7 O
monos O
. O

Clinically O
, O
this O
was O
consistent O
with O
SBP B-SYMPTOM
, O
although O
unfortunately O
, O
fluid O
was O
never O
sent O
for O
cytology O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
those B-SYMPTOM
white I-SYMPTOM
cells I-SYMPTOM
are O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
his B-SYMPTOM
cancer I-SYMPTOM
. O

He B-TREATMENT
underwent I-TREATMENT
abdominal I-TREATMENT
paracentesis I-TREATMENT
approximately O
two O
times O
a O
week O
for O
therapeutic O
. O

This O
had O
to O
be O
performed O
by O
IR O
because O
the B-SYMPTOM
pocket I-SYMPTOM
was O
too O
deep O
to O
access O
from O
the O
bedside O
. O

He O
received O
a O
two O
week O
course O
of O
broad B-TREATMENT
spectrum I-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
and O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Levofloxacin B-TREATMENT
IV I-TREATMENT
for O

against O

2. O
Pulmonary O
. O

From O
a O
pulmonary O
standpoint O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
complain O
of O
shortness B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
breath I-SYMPTOM
. O

His B-SYMPTOM
apical I-SYMPTOM
pneumothorax I-SYMPTOM
from O
the O
outside O
hospital O
had O
resolved O
. O

Chest O
xray O
was O
consistent O
with O
pleurodesis B-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
with O
persistent B-SYMPTOM
abdomen I-SYMPTOM
distention I-SYMPTOM
, O
there O
is O
likely O
restrictive B-SYMPTOM
deficit I-SYMPTOM
and O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
after O
each O
tap O
, O
he O
at O
times O
became O
hypotensive B-SYMPTOM
and O
with O
some B-TREATMENT
mild I-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
resuscitation I-TREATMENT
decompensated O
with O
pulmonary B-SYMPTOM
edema I-SYMPTOM
, O
requiring O
both O
albumin B-TREATMENT
and O
Lasix B-TREATMENT
to O
try O
to O
mobilize O
third B-SYMPTOM
space I-SYMPTOM
fluids I-SYMPTOM
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
discharge O
, O
he O
is O
stating O
approximately O
91 O
to O
92% O
on O
three O
to O
four O
liters O
. O

Chest O
xray O
is O
still O
consistent O
with O
volume B-SYMPTOM
overload I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
continue O
to O
try O
to O
alternate O
albumin B-TREATMENT
and O
Lasix B-TREATMENT
to O
mobilize O
his B-SYMPTOM
fluid I-SYMPTOM
. O

3. O
Cardiovascular O
. O

He O
had O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia B-SYMPTOM
without O
subsequent B-SYMPTOM
fall I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
blood I-SYMPTOM
pressure I-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
his O
admission O
. O

He O
was O
ruled O
out O
for O
a B-SYMPTOM
myocardial I-SYMPTOM
infarction I-SYMPTOM
. O

Echocardiogram O
showed O
50% O
ejection O
fraction O
with O
mild B-SYMPTOM
mitral I-SYMPTOM
regurgitation I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
did O
not O
show O
any O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia B-SYMPTOM
throughout O
the O
remainder O
of O
his B-TREATMENT
hospital I-TREATMENT
course I-TREATMENT
. O

4. O

His B-TREATMENT
Avandia I-TREATMENT
was O
discontinued O
secondary O
to O

. O

He O
is O
being O
maintained O
on O
glipizide B-TREATMENT
and O
sliding B-TREATMENT
scale I-TREATMENT
insulin I-TREATMENT
. O

5. O
Heme O
. O

From O
a O
heme O
standpoint O
, O
he O
presented O
anemic B-SYMPTOM
and O
with O
an B-SYMPTOM
elevated I-SYMPTOM
PT I-SYMPTOM
INR I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
required O
a B-TREATMENT
few I-TREATMENT
transfusions I-TREATMENT
during O
his B-TREATMENT
hospital I-TREATMENT
course I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
also O
required O
FFP B-TREATMENT
initially O
to O
reverse O
his B-SYMPTOM
coagulopathy I-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
this O
resolved O
on O
its O
own O
over O
the B-TREATMENT
hospital I-TREATMENT
course I-TREATMENT
. O

His O
INR O
normalized O
, O
however O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
he O
developed O
bilateral B-SYMPTOM
deep I-SYMPTOM
venous I-SYMPTOM
thromboses I-SYMPTOM
during O
his B-TREATMENT
hospital I-TREATMENT
course I-TREATMENT
and O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Lovenox B-TREATMENT
. O

6. O
Renal O
. O

He O
had O
a O
creatinine O
of O
4.0 O
on O
admission O
and O
this O
decreased O
down O
to O
the O
mid O
ones O
with O
fluid B-TREATMENT
, O
currently O
at O
1.7 O
on O
discharge O
. O

From O
his O
urinalysis O
, O
he O
has O
mostly O
a B-SYMPTOM
prerenal I-SYMPTOM
state I-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
he O
does O
require O
diuresis B-TREATMENT
to O
prevent O
increased B-SYMPTOM
volume I-SYMPTOM
overload I-SYMPTOM
in O
his O
lungs O
from O
his B-SYMPTOM
hypoalbunemic I-SYMPTOM
state I-SYMPTOM
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
Nutrition O
was O
following O
, O
initially O
with O
a O
low O
fat O
, O
low O
cholesterol O
, O
low O
sugar O
diet O
. O

His O
appetite O
is O
decreasing O
somewhat O
as O
his B-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
progresses O
, O
therefore O
, O
we O
have O
liberalized O
his O
diet O
for O
him O
to O
take O
what O
he O
wishes O
. O

7. O
ID O

Please O

He O

broad B-TREATMENT
spectrum I-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
for O
a O
14 O

for O
clinical B-SYMPTOM
SBP I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Levofloxacin B-TREATMENT

The O

pancreatic B-SYMPTOM
cancer I-SYMPTOM
with O
a O
questions O
of O
palliative B-TREATMENT
chemotherapy I-TREATMENT

However O
, O
given O
his B-SYMPTOM
rapid I-SYMPTOM
clinical I-SYMPTOM
decline I-SYMPTOM
, O
this O
was O
deferred O
and O
I O
do O
not O
suspect O
that O
he O
will O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
this O
, O
as O
the O
degree O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
decline I-SYMPTOM
bodes O
a O
poor O
prognosis O
for O
him O
. O

His B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
here O
has O
been O
controlled O
, O
initially O
on O
Oxycontin B-TREATMENT
with O
morphine B-TREATMENT
for O
breakthrough B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
. O

As O
he O
becomes O
progressively B-SYMPTOM
more I-SYMPTOM
somnolent I-SYMPTOM
, O
this O
will O
likely O
need O
to O
be O
switched O
to O
IV B-TREATMENT

PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
pleasant O
83-year-old O
retired O
psychiatrist O
who O
presents O
with O
a O
chief O
complaint O
of O
gait B-SYMPTOM
difficulty I-SYMPTOM
for O
the O
last O
five O
to O
six O
months O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
laryngeal B-SYMPTOM
cancer I-SYMPTOM
in O
2000 O
and O
2001 O
, O
CVA B-SYMPTOM

who O
has O
a O
six O
month O
history O
of O
progressive B-SYMPTOM
difficulty I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
ambulation I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
was O
in O
previously O
good O
health O
when O
he O
reports O
starting O
to O
notice O
problems B-SYMPTOM
ambulating I-SYMPTOM
about O
six O
months O
ago O
. O

His O
partner O
also O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
been O
having O
more B-SYMPTOM
difficulty I-SYMPTOM
with I-SYMPTOM
ADLs I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
reported O
that O
he O
began O
with O
difficulty B-SYMPTOM
buttoning I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM
shirt I-SYMPTOM
for O
many O
years O
since O
after O
a B-SYMPTOM
stroke I-SYMPTOM
but O
now O
reports O
that O
on O
occasion O
she O
would O
ask O
him O
why O
he O
was O
doing O
certain O
things O
and O
he O
could O
not O
give O
a O
concrete O
example O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
having O
a B-SYMPTOM
hard I-SYMPTOM
time I-SYMPTOM
walking I-SYMPTOM
and O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
felt O
weaker O
. O

He O
has O
had O
uncoordination B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM
feet I-SYMPTOM
and O
began O
having O
a B-TREATMENT
cane I-TREATMENT
four O
to O
five O
months O
ago O
with O
the B-SYMPTOM
increasing I-SYMPTOM
weakness I-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
was O
especially O
bad O
when O
trying O
to O
arise O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
seen O
his O
primary O
care O
physician O
who O
referred O
him O
to O
physical O
therapy O
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
gait I-SYMPTOM
weakness I-SYMPTOM
but O
his B-SYMPTOM
symptoms I-SYMPTOM
failed O
to O
improve O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
progress O
until O
two O
weeks O
prior O
to O
admission O
when O
he O
was O
found O
in O
the O
bathtub O
, O
unsteady B-SYMPTOM
and O
fell O
trying O
to O
steady O
himself O
. O

The O
patient O
could O
not O
be O
moved O
and O
had O
to O
have O
911 O
called O
for O
help O
. O

Since O
that O
time O
he O
had O
been O
ambulating O
with O
a B-TREATMENT
walker I-TREATMENT
and O
has O
had O
increasing B-SYMPTOM
difficulty I-SYMPTOM
with I-SYMPTOM
falls I-SYMPTOM
in O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
again O
seen O
by O
his O
primary O
care O
physician O
and O
a O
CG O
scan O
revealed O
a B-SYMPTOM
mass I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
parietal I-SYMPTOM
lobe I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O

was O
consulted O
about O
the O

The O

concluded O
that O
because O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
hematuria I-SYMPTOM
seemed O
to O
be O
stable O
and O

at O
about O
29-30 O

there O
is O
no O

to I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
kidney I-SYMPTOM
. O

Urology O
consultation O
thinks O
that O
cystoscopy B-TREATMENT
would O
not O
add O
any O

and O
only O
would O
consider O
a B-TREATMENT
right I-TREATMENT
nephrostomy I-TREATMENT
if O
renal B-SYMPTOM
function I-SYMPTOM
failed O
to O
improve O
. O

After O
admission O
, O
the O

was O
treated O
conservatively O
to O
correct O
his B-SYMPTOM
electrolyte I-SYMPTOM

He O
was O
given O

29.4 O
. O

After O

, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
hematocrit O
rose O
to O
37.7 O
on O
the O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
given O
sodium B-TREATMENT
bicarbonate I-TREATMENT
to O
correct O
his B-SYMPTOM
metabolic I-SYMPTOM

. O

He O
continued O
to O
pass O
about O
1500-2000 O
cc O

a O
day O
and O
his O
renal O
function O
improved O

on O
the O

. O

During O

also O
developed O

ASSESSMENT O
: O

The O
assessment O
was O
that O
he O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
GI I-SYMPTOM
bleed I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
transfused O
and O
then O
evaluated O
by O
GI O
. O

Endoscopy O
showed O
multiple B-SYMPTOM
angio I-SYMPTOM
ectasias I-SYMPTOM
throughout I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
stomach I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
received O
multiple B-TREATMENT
treatments I-TREATMENT
for O
this O
over O
the O
succeeding O
weeks O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
was O
transfused O
. O

His O
platelet O
count O
was O
maintained O
with O
platelet B-TREATMENT
transfusion I-TREATMENT
as O
necessary O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
Octreotide B-TREATMENT
to O
try O
to O
slow O
down O
the B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
measures O
, O
his B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
was O
never O
totally O
controlled O
. O

He O
then O
had O
an B-TREATMENT
angiogram I-TREATMENT
with I-TREATMENT
Gel I-TREATMENT
foam I-TREATMENT
to O
try O
to O
control O
his B-SYMPTOM
GI I-SYMPTOM
bleed I-SYMPTOM
. O

Again O
, O
this O
was O
unsuccessful O
. O

At O
that O
point O
he O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
change I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
mental I-SYMPTOM
status I-SYMPTOM
and O
was O
no B-SYMPTOM
longer I-SYMPTOM
responsive I-SYMPTOM
. O

Given O
this O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
make O
his O

only O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
he O
was O
made O
