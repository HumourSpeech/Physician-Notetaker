units O
an O
hour O
. O

It O
is O
discontinued O
at O
the O
time O
of O
transport O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
received O
physical B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
and O
occupational B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
and O
her O
recovery O
is O
near O
complete O
. O

During O
evaluation O
of O
her O
neurologic O
status O
, O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
for O
several O
months O
prior O
to O
admission O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
been O
too B-SYMPTOM
unsteady I-SYMPTOM
to I-SYMPTOM
ambulate I-SYMPTOM
. O

On O
our O
exam O
she O
is O
found O
to O
have O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
ataxia B-SYMPTOM
, O
especially O
in O
the O
midline O
and O
the O
exact O
cause O
of O
this O
is O
unknown O
. O

There O
are O
multiple O
possible O
contributions O
and O
this O
is O
where O
her O
need O
for O
careful O
internal O
medical O
evaluation O
has O
arisen O
. O

At O
the O
time O
we O
were O
to O
embark O
on O
this O
evaluation O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
family O
strongly O
requested O
that O
she O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
Sas O
General O
Hospital O
. O

What O
follows O
is O
a O
summary O
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
medical I-SYMPTOM
problems I-SYMPTOM
and O
their O
possible O
relationship O
to O
her B-SYMPTOM
ataxia I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her B-SYMPTOM
ataxia I-SYMPTOM
is O
likely O
due O
to O
some O
cerebellar O
function O
, O
though O
this O
is O
not O
certain O
. O

Moreover O
her O
MRI O
did O
not O
show O
any B-SYMPTOM
discrete I-SYMPTOM
cerebellar I-SYMPTOM
lesions I-SYMPTOM
. O

Our O
leading O
theory O
at O
this O
point O
is O
that O
her B-SYMPTOM
cerebellar I-SYMPTOM
dysfunction I-SYMPTOM
relates O
to O
perineoplastic B-SYMPTOM
syndrome I-SYMPTOM
, O
relating O
to O
her O
history O
of O
breast B-SYMPTOM
Ca I-SYMPTOM
. O

As O
I O
mentioned O
above O
, O
her O
evaluation O
was O
limited O
by O
her O
cardiologic O
status O
at O
the O
time O
. O

While O
mammogram O
and O
CA-15.3 O
and O
breast O
exam O
are O
all O
normal O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
a B-SYMPTOM
perineoplastic I-SYMPTOM
syndrome I-SYMPTOM
with O
or O
without O
concomitant B-SYMPTOM
breast I-SYMPTOM
Ca I-SYMPTOM
has O
reared O
its O
head O
. O

Two O
possible O
markers O
are O
anti-Hu B-SYMPTOM
syndrome I-SYMPTOM
and O
anti-Yo O
antibody O
. O

These O
tests O
were O
sent O
on O
the O
18th O
and O
are O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
results O
can O
be O
obtained O
by O
paging O

Do O

Joasscchird O

M.D. O
at O
834-364-2251 O
. O

I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
furnish O
the O
results O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
MI B-SYMPTOM
in O
1989 O
. O

Echocardiogram O
no O
longer O
shows O
wall B-SYMPTOM
motion I-SYMPTOM
abnormalities I-SYMPTOM
. O

EKG O
, O
when O
the O
patient O
goes O
out O
of O
left B-SYMPTOM
bundle I-SYMPTOM
branch I-SYMPTOM
block I-SYMPTOM
transiently O
shows O
an B-SYMPTOM
anterolateral I-SYMPTOM
Q/wave I-SYMPTOM
inversion I-SYMPTOM
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
discontinue O
her B-TREATMENT
Isordil I-TREATMENT
to O
improve O
upon O
some B-SYMPTOM
orthostatic I-SYMPTOM
hypotension I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
certain O
whether O
her O
heart O
will O
tolerate O
this O
. O

Persantine O
thallium O
is O
scheduled O
at O
this O
time O
, O
but O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
orthostatic B-SYMPTOM
hypotension I-SYMPTOM
x O
many O
years O
. O

It O
has O
been O
evaluated O
in O
the O
past O
without O
success O
. O

During O
her O
hospitalization O
, O
we O
confirmed O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
, O
even O
when O
she O
was O
hydrated O
with O
saline B-TREATMENT
, O
to O
a O
fractional O
excretion O
of O
sodium O
of O
2% O
. O

Studies O
of O
her O
autonomic O
system O
did O
not O
document O
any B-SYMPTOM
dysautonomia I-SYMPTOM
. O

Studies O
of O
skin O
galvanic O
conduction O
were O
normal O
and O
her O
RR O
interval O
evaluation O
was O
not O
abnormal B-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
is O
a B-SYMPTOM
chronic I-SYMPTOM
problem I-SYMPTOM
but O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
her B-SYMPTOM
current I-SYMPTOM
weakness I-SYMPTOM
and O
inability B-SYMPTOM
to I-SYMPTOM
walk I-SYMPTOM
. O

Florinef B-TREATMENT
is O
to O
be O
considered O
, O
however O
stopping O
the B-TREATMENT
Isordil I-TREATMENT
is O
one O
goal O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
bronchiectasis B-SYMPTOM
from O
a B-SYMPTOM
childhood I-SYMPTOM
pneumonia I-SYMPTOM
. O

In O
addition O
there O
is O
a O
distant O
history O
of O
M. B-SYMPTOM
kansasaii I-SYMPTOM
infection I-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
has O
been O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Screen O
at O
Sas O
General O
Hospital O
and O
probably O
relates O
to O
her O
lung O
xray O
. O

CT O
at O
the O
Ona O
Hospital O
in O
1989 O
showed O
similar O
findings O
. O

A O
chest O
CT O
was O
to O
be O
performed O
and O
may O
be O
yielding O
. O

A O
PPD O
was O
placed O
and O
is O
to O
be O
read O
on O
Saturday O
, O
4 O
26th O
. O

The O
left O
volar O
forearm O
has O
the O
PPD O
just O
proximal O
to O
the O
wrist O
crease O
and O
a O
candida O
albicans O
placed O
just O
distal O
to O
the O
antecubital O
fossa O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
deep B-SYMPTOM
venous I-SYMPTOM
thrombosis I-SYMPTOM
in O
1990 O
, O
for O
which O
she O
received O
6 O
months O
of O
Coumadin B-TREATMENT
. O

Dopplers O
of O
her O
lower O
extremities O
were O
negative O
on O
this O
admission O
. O

It O
is O
doubtful O
that O
she O
has O
chronic B-SYMPTOM
PE I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
this O
is O
one O
consideration O
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
she O
has O
pulmonary B-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
from O
her B-SYMPTOM
lung I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
so O
this O
is O
a O
consideration O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
mild B-SYMPTOM
hyponatremia I-SYMPTOM
during O
this O
hospitalization O
with O
a O
sodium O
as O
low O
as O
131 O
. O

We O
think O
this O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
an B-SYMPTOM
SIADH I-SYMPTOM
as O
she O
is O
euvolemic O
. O

This O
can O
be O
evaluated O
further O
and O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
at O
this O
time O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
glaucoma B-SYMPTOM
. O

Her B-TREATMENT

diltiazam B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
EP O
service O
was O
consulted O
and O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Cardiac O
Catheterization O
Laboratory O
. O

There O
, O
her O
pulmonary O
wedge O
pressure O
was O
12 O
and O
her O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
was O
4 O
and O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressure O
44/17 O
. O

Her O
left O
ventricular O
contraction O
showed O
akinesis B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
anterior I-SYMPTOM
wall I-SYMPTOM
with O
dyskinesis B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
apex I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
had O
preserved O
inferior O
contraction O
and O
basal O
contraction O
. O

Her O
native O
right O
and O
left O
anterior O
descending O
vessels O
were O
occluded B-SYMPTOM
as O
was O
an O
obtuse O
marginal O
branch O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
to O
the O
high O
diagonal O
or O
high O
obtuse O
marginal O
was O
occluded B-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
to O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
was O
also O
occluded B-SYMPTOM
. O

The B-TREATMENT
saphenous I-TREATMENT
vein I-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
to I-TREATMENT
the I-TREATMENT
second I-TREATMENT
obtuse I-TREATMENT
marginal I-TREATMENT
was O
open O
with O
no O
significant B-SYMPTOM
stenosis I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
there O
was O
an B-SYMPTOM
outflow I-SYMPTOM
lesion I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
obtuse I-SYMPTOM
marginal I-SYMPTOM
2 I-SYMPTOM
as O
well O
as O
severe B-SYMPTOM
distal I-SYMPTOM
lesion I-SYMPTOM
as O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O
2 O
fed O
the O
posterior O
descending O
artery O
. O

This O
was O
considered O
her B-SYMPTOM
culprit I-SYMPTOM
lesion I-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
was O
considered O
too O
high O
risk O
for O
angioplasty B-TREATMENT
because O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
severe I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
in O
the B-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
saphenous O
vein O
harvested O
from O
both O
thighs O
. O

Her O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
was O
also O
unused O
. O

It O
was O
also O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
failure O
to O
sense O
with O
the O
atrial O
lead O
. O

She O
would O
not O
sense O
the O
atrial O
contraction O
and O
the O
fire O
and O
this O
occasionally O
led O
to O
competition B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
firing I-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
was O
intermittent O
. O

The O
P O
wave O
amplitude O
was O
.6 O
and O
this O
could O
not O
be O
totally O
sensed O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
management B-TREATMENT
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
coronary I-SYMPTOM
artery I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
and O
evaluation O
of O
her B-TREATMENT
pacemaker I-TREATMENT
. O

It O
was O
noted O
that O
she O
became O
very B-SYMPTOM
symptomatic I-SYMPTOM
when O
she O
was O
not O
on O
a B-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
but O
that O
on O
a B-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
she O
had O
significant B-SYMPTOM
pacemaker I-SYMPTOM
failure I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her B-TREATMENT
pacemaker I-TREATMENT
was O
set O
to O
a O
VVI O
mode O
which O
sensed O
appropriately O
. O

She O
was O
in O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

When O
her B-TREATMENT
pacemaker I-TREATMENT
was O
in O
a O
sinus O
rhythm O
without O
a B-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
, O
she O
had O
significant B-SYMPTOM
angina I-SYMPTOM
. O

Carotid O
non-invasive O
testing O
was O
unremarkable O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
Dr. O
Niste O
Graft O
. O

He O
felt O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
a O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
graft O
candidate O
because O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
lack I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
conduit I-SYMPTOM
and O
because O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
a B-SYMPTOM
large I-SYMPTOM
anterior I-SYMPTOM
myocardial I-SYMPTOM
infarction I-SYMPTOM
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
maximize O
her B-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blockers I-TREATMENT
and O
nitrates B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
Dr. O
No O
of O
the O
Pacemaker O
Service O
. O

On O
August O
20 O
, O
under O
local B-TREATMENT
anesthesia I-TREATMENT
the O
right O
pectoral O
region O
was O
explored O
and O
the O
leads O
disconnected O
and O
the B-TREATMENT
pulse I-TREATMENT
generator I-TREATMENT
changed O
to O
a B-TREATMENT
CPI I-TREATMENT
unit I-TREATMENT
in O
which O
the O
sensitivity O
could O
be O
adjusted O
to O
.15 O
mm. O
, O
which O
permitted O
appropriate O
atrial O
sensing O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the B-TREATMENT
prior I-TREATMENT
generator I-TREATMENT
and O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the B-TREATMENT
leads I-TREATMENT
. O

It O
just O
needed O
a O
unit O
that O
could O
have O
more O
sensitivity O
in O
the O
atrial O
mode O
. O

She O
tolerated O
this O
well O
. O

Her B-TREATMENT
medications I-TREATMENT
were O
resumed O
. O

She O
ambulated O
without O
difficulty O
and O
was O
discharged O
to O

Patient O
subsequently O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
CMED O
CCU O
on O
2017-01-13 O
for O
further O
monitoring O
. O

Patient B-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
hypoxia I-SYMPTOM
was O
felt O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
caused O
by O
pneumonia B-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
appropriate B-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
. O

Etiology O
of O
patient B-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
tachypnea I-SYMPTOM
was O
unclear O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
patient O
's O
etiology O
of O
seizure B-SYMPTOM
was O
not O
quite O
clear O
, O
but O
thought O
possibly O
secondary O
to O
alcohol B-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
benzodiazepine I-SYMPTOM
withdrawal I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
received O
EEG O
, O
MRI O
, O
LP O
. O

Subsequently O
EEG O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
no O
seizure B-SYMPTOM
activity I-SYMPTOM
. O

MRI O
was O
suboptimal O
due O
to O
motion O
artifact O
and O
LP O
was O
unremarkable O
. O

Despite O
absence O
of O
seizure B-SYMPTOM
activity I-SYMPTOM
on O
EEG O
, O
patient O
was O
continued O
on O
Dilantin B-TREATMENT
. O

Her B-SYMPTOM
delirium I-SYMPTOM
was O
felt O
possibly O
secondary O
to O
withdrawal B-SYMPTOM
versus O
toxic B-SYMPTOM
metabolic I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
gradually O
improved O
slowly O
, O
and O
therefore O
patient O
did O
not O
receive O
treatment B-TREATMENT
for O
barbiturate B-SYMPTOM
withdrawal I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her O
mental O
status O
, O
tachypnea B-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
hypoxia B-SYMPTOM
all O
improved O
, O
and O
patient O
was O
subsequently O
transferred O
back O

on O
2017-01-15 O

the O

be O
improved O
back O

the O
CMED O

, O
and O
she O
exhibited O
no O
evidence O
of O
barbiturate B-SYMPTOM

She O
was O
continued O
on O

, O
and O
plan O
was O
for O
psychiatric O

when O
medical B-SYMPTOM
issues I-SYMPTOM

On O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

1) O
NEUROLOGY O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
for O
intensive O
monitoring O
due O
to O
his B-SYMPTOM
frail I-SYMPTOM
condition I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
had O
an O
electroencephalogram O
performed O
on O
his O
initial O
admittance O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
which O
did O
not O
show O
any O
evidence O
of O
seizure B-SYMPTOM
activity I-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
did O
, O
however O
, O
show O
diffuse B-SYMPTOM
slowing I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
given O
1.5 O
grams O
of O
Dilantin B-TREATMENT
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
as O
well O
as O
2 O
mgs O
of O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
Ativan I-TREATMENT
which O
did O
little O
to O
stop O
his B-SYMPTOM
rhythmic I-SYMPTOM
blinking I-SYMPTOM
that O
he O
showed O
from O
time O
to O
time O
on O
examination O
. O

His B-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
; O
his B-SYMPTOM
high I-SYMPTOM
blood I-SYMPTOM
pressure I-SYMPTOM
was O
controlled O
with O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
nitroglycerine I-TREATMENT
in O
the O
early O
going O
and O
then O
he O
was O
switched O
to O
an B-TREATMENT
oral I-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
for O
better O
control O
after O
he O
was O
removed O
from O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
do O
well O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
and O
was O
quite O
surprisingly O
intact O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
his O
body O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
ability O
to O
move O
. O

He O
did O
consistently O
have O
more O
movement O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
body O
than O
on O
the O
right O
, O
but O
he O
gradually O
became O
more O
awake O
and O
alert O
and O
communicative O
and O
his B-TREATMENT
endotracheal I-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
was O
removed O
on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
admission O
. O

His O
diagnosis O
of O
progressive B-SYMPTOM
supranuclear I-SYMPTOM
palsy I-SYMPTOM
was O
placed O
under O
question O
on O
further O
examination O
of O
his O
eye O
movement O
since O
he O
was O
able O
to O
have O
excellent O
superior O
gaze O
especially O
with O
the O
bells O
phenomenon O
which O
would O
not O
be O
seen O
with O
progressive B-SYMPTOM
supranuclear I-SYMPTOM
palsy I-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
his B-SYMPTOM
dementing I-SYMPTOM
illness I-SYMPTOM
and O
rigidity B-SYMPTOM
was O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
some O
type O
of O
cortico-basal B-SYMPTOM
ganglia I-SYMPTOM
degeneration I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
clarified O
during O
this O
admission O
. O

It O
was O
not O
felt O
likely O
to O
be O
due O
to O
Parkinson B-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
, O
as O
he O
had O
no O
significant O
response O
to O
Eldopa B-TREATMENT
in O
the O
past O
and O
the O
patient O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
tremor B-SYMPTOM
, O
although O
he O
was O
quite B-SYMPTOM
rigid I-SYMPTOM
and O
bradykinetic B-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
had O
an O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
performed O
on O
October O
18 O
, O
1996 O
. O

This O
showed O
the B-SYMPTOM
unchanged I-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
temporal I-SYMPTOM
parenchymal I-SYMPTOM
interparenchymal I-SYMPTOM
hematoma I-SYMPTOM
and O
the B-SYMPTOM
old I-SYMPTOM
embolic I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
frontal I-SYMPTOM
infarct I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
new B-SYMPTOM
lesions I-SYMPTOM
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
his O
susceptibility O
studies O
to O
suggest O
old B-SYMPTOM
bleeds I-SYMPTOM
which O
might O
have O
been O
consistent O
with O
amylase B-SYMPTOM
angiopathy I-SYMPTOM
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
gadolinium O
scan O
did O
not O
show O
enhancement B-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
area O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
hemorrhage I-SYMPTOM
, O
so O
tumor B-SYMPTOM
was O
felt O
to O
be O
unlikely O
. O

However O
, O
this O
issue O
will O
need O
to O
be O
re-evaluated O
in O
six O
months O
time O
once O
the B-SYMPTOM
hematoma I-SYMPTOM
is O
less O
prominent O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
possibly O
an B-SYMPTOM
underlying I-SYMPTOM
tumor I-SYMPTOM
or O
arterial B-SYMPTOM
venous I-SYMPTOM
malformation I-SYMPTOM
that O
could O
be O
currently O
compressed O
by O
the O
area O
of O
hemorrhage B-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
etiology O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
bleed I-SYMPTOM
was O
felt O
to O
be O
most O
likely O
secondary O
to O
hypertension B-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
these O
other O
causes O
could O
also O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
. O

2) O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

His O
electrocardiogram O
was O
concerning O
for O
ischemia B-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
on O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
TNG I-TREATMENT
and O
was O
supratherapeutic B-SYMPTOM
on O
his B-TREATMENT
anti-coagulation I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
did O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
slight I-SYMPTOM
elevation I-SYMPTOM
of O
his O
TPK O
with O
an O
additional O
value O
of O
198 O
with O
a O
MB O
fraction O
of O
5.7 O
, O
which O
makes O
for O
a O
percentage O
of O
2.9 O
. O

That O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
percentage O
that O
he O
had O
and O
after O
this O
his O
percentage O
came O
down O
to O
1.6 O
, O
1.0 O
on O
subsequent O
CKMBs O
and O
was O
felt O
that O
he O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
very I-SYMPTOM
small I-SYMPTOM
&quot; I-SYMPTOM
leaflet I-SYMPTOM
&quot; I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
remained O
chest B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
free O
throughout O
his O
admission O
. O

3) O
PULMONARY O
: O

After O
his B-TREATMENT
initial I-TREATMENT
intubation I-TREATMENT
he O
remained O
quite O
stable O
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
be O
at O
a B-SYMPTOM
large I-SYMPTOM
aspiration I-SYMPTOM
risk I-SYMPTOM
given O
his B-SYMPTOM
decreased I-SYMPTOM
mental I-SYMPTOM
status I-SYMPTOM
and O
the O
lack O
of O
presence O
of O
a O
gag O
reflex O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
given O
aggressive B-TREATMENT
pulmonary I-TREATMENT
toilets I-TREATMENT
including O
chest B-TREATMENT
physical I-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
and O
aspiration B-TREATMENT
precautions I-TREATMENT
and O
the O
patient O
did O
not O
develop O
any B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
symptoms I-SYMPTOM
during O
his O
admission O
. O

4) O
HEMATOLOGY O
: O

He O
had O
his O
prothrombin O
time O
reversed O
with O
Vitamin B-TREATMENT
K I-TREATMENT
2 O
mgs O
on O
admission O
subcutaneously O
as O
well O
as O
two O
units O
of O
fresh B-TREATMENT
frozen I-TREATMENT
plasma I-TREATMENT
given O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O

His O
anticoagulation O
status O
had O
to O
be O
monitored O
very O
closely O
due O
to O
his O
history O
of O
deep B-SYMPTOM
venous I-SYMPTOM
thrombosis I-SYMPTOM
and O
pulmonary B-SYMPTOM
embolus I-SYMPTOM
as O
well O
as O
atrial B-SYMPTOM
fibrillation I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
be O
placed O
on O
a O
high O
amount O
of O
anticoagulation B-TREATMENT
because O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
new I-SYMPTOM
intraparenchymal I-SYMPTOM
bleed I-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
his O
goal O
INR O
was O
to O
be O
2.0 O
. O

He O
did O
drop O
below O
1.5 O
at O
one O
time O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
was O
placed O
on O
heparin B-TREATMENT
intravenous I-TREATMENT
to O
carry O
him O
through O
that O
period O
, O
but O
his O
discharge O
INR O
was O
around O
2 O
and O
he O
was O
off O
of O
heparin B-TREATMENT
at O
that O
time O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
he O
would O
have O
very O
close O
monitoring O
of O
his O
anticoagulation O
status O
in O
the O
future O
to O
prevent O
further B-SYMPTOM
problems I-SYMPTOM
. O

5) O
GASTROINTESTINAL O
: O

He O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
speech O
and O
swallow O
pathology O
group O
at O
the O
Ph O
University O
Of O
Medical O
Center O
and O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
swallow O
on O
his O
own O
with O
a B-TREATMENT
soft I-TREATMENT
solid I-TREATMENT
diet I-TREATMENT
with O
supervision O
. O

Thus O
, O
his B-TREATMENT
nasogastric I-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
was O
discontinued O
on O
October O
19 O
, O
1996 O
and O
he O
tolerated O
feeding O
quite O
well O
. O

In O
discussions O
with O
the O
family O
, O
given O
his O
age O
and O
number O
of O
medical B-SYMPTOM
problems I-SYMPTOM
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
should O
be O
do O
not O
resuscitate O
should O
he O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
terminal I-SYMPTOM
cardiac I-SYMPTOM
event I-SYMPTOM
during O
his O
admission O
or O
during O
future O
admissions O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
still O
an B-TREATMENT
intubation I-TREATMENT
candidate O
if O
it O
were O
felt O
to O
be O
a B-TREATMENT
short I-TREATMENT
term I-TREATMENT
procedure I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
family O
realizes O
that O
the O
long O
term O
outlook O
for O
this O
patient O
is O
not O
very O
good O
, O
but O
they O
would O
like O
to O
currently O
continue O
to O
provide O
him O
with O
all B-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
necessary I-TREATMENT
, O
short O
of O
resuscitation B-TREATMENT
measures I-TREATMENT
or O
heroic B-TREATMENT
measures I-TREATMENT
should O
he O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
cardiopulmonary I-SYMPTOM
arrest I-SYMPTOM

held O
with O
his O

with O
his O

: O

1. O
NEUROLOGY O
: O

Mr. O
Roach O
was O
transported O
to O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
from O
the O
trauma O
bay O
. O

Upon O
arrival O
, O
Neurosurgery O
promptly O
placed O
V. B-TREATMENT
Holtzen I-TREATMENT
bolt I-TREATMENT
. O

This O
allowed O
continuous O
monitoring O
of O
intracranial O
pressure O
. O

Notably O
, O
intracranial O
pressure O
was O
17 O
when O
the B-TREATMENT
bolt I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
. O

During O
his O
hospitalization O
, O
his O
intracranial O
pressure O
was O
monitored O
very O
closely O
and O
maintained O
to O
a O
level O
of O
less O
than O
20 O
. O

To O
do O
this O
, O
mannitol B-TREATMENT
25 O
mg O

6h. O
was O
used O
. O

While O
using O
mannitol B-TREATMENT
, O
his O
serum O
osmolalities O
were O
followed O
closely O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
to O
monitoring O
his O
intracranial O
pressure O
, O
his O
systemic O
blood O
pressures O
were O
maintained O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
that O
his O
cerebral O
perfusion O
pressure O
was O
maintained O
at O
70 O
mmHg O
. O

A O
parameter O

status O
PaCO2 O
which O
was O
maintained O
between O
35 O
and O

during O
his O
hospitalization O
. O

Mr. O
Roach O
was O
kept O
sedated B-TREATMENT
with O

in I-SYMPTOM
neurologic I-SYMPTOM
examination I-SYMPTOM
. O

During O
his O
hospitalization O
, O
two O
subsequent O
CAT O
scans O
were O
obtained O
; O
one O
on O
hospital O
day O
two O
. O

This O
CAT O
scan O
revealed O
possible O
worsening O
and O
was O
read O
as O
epidural B-SYMPTOM
versus O
subdural B-SYMPTOM
bleed I-SYMPTOM
. O

After O
a O
discussion O
with O
both O
Radiology O
and O
Neurosurgery O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
that O
the O
worsening O
did O
not O
appear O
significant O
, O
and O
this O
was O
not O
accompanied O
by O
a B-SYMPTOM
change I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM
clinical I-SYMPTOM
condition I-SYMPTOM
. O

His O
intracranial O
pressure O
remained O

was O
obtained O
on O
hospital O
day O
three O

This O
examination O
was O
unchanged O
from O
the O
previous O
examination O
. O

Again O
, O
his O
intracranial O
pressure O
and O

CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

As O
described O
in O

a O
coronary O
perfusion O
pressure O
of O
greater O
than O
70 O
. O

A B-TREATMENT
pulmonary I-TREATMENT
artery I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
on O
hospital O

four O
. O

This B-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
when O
the O

. O

Gastroenterology O
was O
consulted O
for O
this O
. O

. O

She O
worked O
daily O
with O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
a O
53-year-old O
male O
with O
a O
longstanding O
history O
of O
renal B-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
with O
multiple B-SYMPTOM
complications I-SYMPTOM
and O
problems B-SYMPTOM
related O
to O
vascular O
access O
and O
hypercoagulable B-SYMPTOM
state I-SYMPTOM
. O

These O
culminated O
in O
an B-TREATMENT
attempted I-TREATMENT
cadaveric I-TREATMENT
kidney I-TREATMENT
transplant I-TREATMENT
undertaken O
on O
12/16/97 O
, O
which O
was O
complicated O
by O
thrombosis B-SYMPTOM
and O
necrosis B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
cadaveric I-SYMPTOM
renal I-SYMPTOM
vein I-SYMPTOM
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
required O
a B-TREATMENT
transplant I-TREATMENT
nephrectomy I-TREATMENT
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
course O
was O
subsequently O
characterized O
by O
recurrent B-SYMPTOM
pneumonias I-SYMPTOM
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
aspiration B-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
by O
hemodynamic B-SYMPTOM
instability I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
from O
the O
Transplant O
Service O
for O
ventilatory B-TREATMENT
management I-TREATMENT
in O
the O
setting O
of O
hypotension B-SYMPTOM
. O

On O
transfer O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
sedated B-TREATMENT
, O
but O
was O
unresponsive B-SYMPTOM
and O
extremely B-SYMPTOM
dyssynchronous I-SYMPTOM
with O
the B-TREATMENT
ventilator I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
have O
substantial B-SYMPTOM
auto I-SYMPTOM
PEEP I-SYMPTOM
with O
an B-SYMPTOM
elevated I-SYMPTOM
dead I-SYMPTOM
space I-SYMPTOM
. O

A O
pulmonary O
arteriogram O
on O
01/03/98 O
demonstrated O
multiple B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
emboli I-SYMPTOM
, O
likely O
less O
than O
one O
week O
old O
, O
possibly O
introduced O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
renal I-SYMPTOM
vein I-SYMPTOM
thrombosis I-SYMPTOM
of O
12/19/97 O
. O

An B-TREATMENT
inferior I-TREATMENT
vena I-TREATMENT
cava I-TREATMENT
filter I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
; O
lower O
extremity O
noninvasive O
studies O
were O
negative O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
high B-TREATMENT
pressures I-TREATMENT
to O
ventilate O
adequately O
, O
possibly O
related O
to O
an B-SYMPTOM
abdominal I-SYMPTOM
compartment I-SYMPTOM
syndrome I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
had O
undergone O
two B-TREATMENT
abdominal I-TREATMENT
procedures I-TREATMENT
following O
explantation O
. O

The O
physiology O
at O
the O
time O
of O
transfer O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
was O
consistent O
with O
a B-SYMPTOM
septic I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
. O

CT O
scan O
demonstrated O
retroperitoneal B-SYMPTOM
collection I-SYMPTOM
containing O
both O
free B-SYMPTOM
air I-SYMPTOM
and O
extravasated B-SYMPTOM
contrast I-SYMPTOM
material I-SYMPTOM
. O

For O
the O
concern O
of O
a B-SYMPTOM
perforated I-SYMPTOM
viscus I-SYMPTOM
, O
the O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
on O
01/06/98 O
, O
during O
which O
the O
bowel O
was O
run O
without O
evidence O
of O
perforation B-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
unstable B-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
taken O
to O
fluoroscopy O
, O
where O
oral O
contrast O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
extravasating O
through O
a O
posterior O
duodenum O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
again O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
01/08/98 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
a B-TREATMENT
gastrojejunostomy I-TREATMENT
was O
performed O
with O
stapling B-TREATMENT
across I-TREATMENT
the I-TREATMENT
gastroduodenal I-TREATMENT
junction I-TREATMENT
, O
introduction O
of O
five B-TREATMENT
Jackson-Pratt I-TREATMENT

, O
cholecystotomy B-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
, O
gastrostomy B-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
jejunostomy B-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
had O
an B-SYMPTOM
extensive I-SYMPTOM
estimated I-SYMPTOM
blood I-SYMPTOM
loss I-SYMPTOM
requiring O
multiple B-TREATMENT
blood I-TREATMENT
products I-TREATMENT
and O
fluid B-TREATMENT
resuscitation I-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
. O

Accompanying O
this O
during O
this O
period O
were O
elevations B-SYMPTOM
in O
liver O
function O
studies O
and O
amylase O
and O
lipase O
consistent O
with O
pancreatic B-SYMPTOM
inflammation I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
was O
aggressively O
treated O
with O
fluid B-TREATMENT
resuscitation I-TREATMENT
and O
pressors B-TREATMENT
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
septic I-SYMPTOM
physiology I-SYMPTOM
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
cardiac B-SYMPTOM
tamponade I-SYMPTOM
or O
specific B-SYMPTOM
underlying I-SYMPTOM
coronary I-SYMPTOM
dysfunction I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
appropriate B-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
Serratia I-SYMPTOM
pneumonia I-SYMPTOM
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
abdominal I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
have O
an B-SYMPTOM
underlying I-SYMPTOM
hypercoagulable I-SYMPTOM
state I-SYMPTOM
, O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
source O
for O
the B-SYMPTOM
repeated I-SYMPTOM
clots I-SYMPTOM
. O

Because O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
problems I-SYMPTOM
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
full B-TREATMENT
heparinization I-TREATMENT
would O
not O
be O
prudent O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
pneumo-boots B-TREATMENT
and O
subcutaneous B-TREATMENT
heparin I-TREATMENT
. O

Attention O
was O
paid O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
metabolic B-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
electrolyte I-SYMPTOM
abnormalities I-SYMPTOM
, O
which O
were O
corrected O
appropriately O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
Mr. O
Less O
continued O
to O
remain O
critically B-SYMPTOM
ill I-SYMPTOM
with O
only O
very O
transient O
mild O
improvement O
with O
drainage B-TREATMENT
of O
additional B-SYMPTOM
retroperitoneal I-SYMPTOM
fluid I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
remained O
pressor B-SYMPTOM
dependent I-SYMPTOM
, O
as O
well O
as O
dependent B-SYMPTOM
upon O
mechanical B-TREATMENT
ventilatory I-TREATMENT
assistance I-TREATMENT
. O

His O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
atrial B-SYMPTOM
fibrillation I-SYMPTOM
requiring O
cardioversion B-TREATMENT
. O

He O
had O
an B-SYMPTOM
ongoing I-SYMPTOM
requirement I-SYMPTOM
for O
high B-TREATMENT
volume I-TREATMENT
resuscitation I-TREATMENT
and O
was O
persistently B-SYMPTOM
acidotic I-SYMPTOM
despite O
CV-VVH B-TREATMENT
in O
the O
face O
of O
bicarbonate B-TREATMENT
replenishment I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
also O
appeared O
to O
have O
stool O
from O
his B-SYMPTOM
Jackson-Pratt I-SYMPTOM
site I-SYMPTOM
and O
right B-SYMPTOM
oblique I-SYMPTOM
incision I-SYMPTOM
. O

Bloody B-SYMPTOM
drainage I-SYMPTOM
from O
his B-SYMPTOM
increasingly I-SYMPTOM
distended I-SYMPTOM
abdomen I-SYMPTOM
was O
noted O
. O

Extensive O
discussions O
were O
carried O
out O
with O
Mrs. O
Less O
condition O
was O
irretrievable O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
continued O
massive B-SYMPTOM
retroperitoneal I-SYMPTOM
contamination I-SYMPTOM
and O
probable O
multiple B-SYMPTOM
enteric I-SYMPTOM
fistulae I-SYMPTOM
from O
an B-SYMPTOM
ischemic I-SYMPTOM
bowel I-SYMPTOM
. O

Dr. O
Cantsleddjesc O
felt O
that O
no O
surgical B-TREATMENT
approach I-TREATMENT
to O
this B-SYMPTOM
problem I-SYMPTOM
or O
further B-TREATMENT
intervention I-TREATMENT
or O
radiologic B-TREATMENT
procedures I-TREATMENT
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

All O
physicians O
and O
the O
family O
were O
in O
agreement O
that O
the O
most O
appropriate O
approach O
was O
to O
institute O
comfort B-TREATMENT
measures I-TREATMENT
. O

This O
was O
done O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
appeared O
to O
be O
comfortable O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
with O
his O
family O
at O

Illness O
: O

Ms. O
Swanson O

a O
53 O
yo O
woman O
with O
PMH O
significant O
for O
seizure B-SYMPTOM
disorder I-SYMPTOM
, O
brain B-SYMPTOM

, O
and O
? O
atypical B-SYMPTOM
multiple I-SYMPTOM

who O
presents O
with O
right B-SYMPTOM
face I-SYMPTOM
twitch I-SYMPTOM
and O
right B-SYMPTOM
arm I-SYMPTOM
shaking I-SYMPTOM
. O

History O
is O
obtained O
from O
her O
sister O
, O
William O
from O
Lawrence O
General O
Hospital O
, O
and O
from O
her O
primary O
neurologist O
, O
Dr. O
Brian O
. O

She O
lives O
in O
an O
assisted O
living O
, O
and O
was O
noted O
yesterday O
to O
have O
generalized B-SYMPTOM
tonic-clonic I-SYMPTOM
activity I-SYMPTOM
beginning O
on O
the O
right O
side O
and O
lasting O
90 O
minutes O
. O

EMS O
gave O
her O
valium B-TREATMENT
5 O
mg O
pr O
at O
the O
facility O
and O
brought O
her O
to O
Barnstable O
County O
Hospital O
. O

She O
persisted O
with O
right B-SYMPTOM
sided I-SYMPTOM
seizure I-SYMPTOM
activity I-SYMPTOM
there O
and O
was O
given O
valium B-TREATMENT
10 O
mg O
and O
ativan B-TREATMENT
1 O
mg O
, O
as O
well O
as O
loaded O
with O
dilantin B-TREATMENT
1000 O
mg O
. O

She O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Providence O
Behavioral O
Health O
Hospital O
CMED O
. O

Here O
she O
was O
given O
an B-TREATMENT
additional I-TREATMENT
valium I-TREATMENT
5 O
mg O
x O
2 O
and O
ativan B-TREATMENT
1 O
mg O
x O
3 O
for O
persistent B-SYMPTOM
twitching I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
her I-SYMPTOM
face I-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
hand I-SYMPTOM
. O

Since O
the B-TREATMENT
ativan I-TREATMENT
, O
her B-SYMPTOM
facial I-SYMPTOM
twitching I-SYMPTOM
has O
apparently O
improved O
, O
but O
she O
continues O
to O
have O
hand B-SYMPTOM
twitches I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
also O
had O
an O
EEG O
, O
which O
showed O
left B-SYMPTOM
sided I-SYMPTOM
slowing I-SYMPTOM
on O
preliminary O
read O
. O

Apparently O
she O
has O
a O
long O
history O
of O
seizure B-SYMPTOM
disorder I-SYMPTOM
, O
possibly O
from O
a O
history O
of O
traumatic B-SYMPTOM
brain I-SYMPTOM
injury I-SYMPTOM
( O
though O
per O
Dr. O
Paula O
, O

records O
from O
that O
hospitalization O
indicate O
she O
may O
have O
only O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
very I-SYMPTOM
mild I-SYMPTOM
injury I-SYMPTOM
) O
and O
has O
been O
managed O
on O
dilantin B-TREATMENT
and O
keppra B-TREATMENT
. O

Since O
she O
has O
seen O
Dr. O
Ollie O
, O
she O
has O
had O
at O
least O
two O
episodes O
of O
status B-SYMPTOM
epilepticus I-SYMPTOM
and O
one B-SYMPTOM
generalized I-SYMPTOM
seizure I-SYMPTOM
, O
as O
well O
as O
some B-SYMPTOM
less I-SYMPTOM
significant I-SYMPTOM
seizures I-SYMPTOM
which O
are O
characterized O
by O
left B-SYMPTOM
gaze I-SYMPTOM
preference I-SYMPTOM
and O
left B-SYMPTOM
sided I-SYMPTOM
tonic-clonic I-SYMPTOM
activity I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her O
dilantin O
levels O
had O
been O
somewhat O
difficult O
to O
control O
. O

He O
tried O
adding O
lamictal B-TREATMENT
, O
but O
this O
caused O
a B-SYMPTOM
rash I-SYMPTOM
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
her O
last O
visit O
( O
2015-03-18 O
) O
Dr. O
Bradley O
had O
discussed O
the O
addition O
of O
a B-TREATMENT
third I-TREATMENT
Castelluccio I-TREATMENT
, O
possibly O
zonegran B-TREATMENT
( O
less O
likely O
topamax B-TREATMENT
), O
to O
the B-TREATMENT
dilantin I-TREATMENT
200 O
mg O
bid O
and O
keppra B-TREATMENT
1500 O
mg O
bid O
. O

Her O
sister O
had O
wanted O
to O
keep O
the O
current O
course O
because O
she O
felt O
she O
was O
doing O
well O
where O
she O
was O
living O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
upset O
that O
. O

However O
, O
she O
had O
several O
dilantin O
levels O
drawn O
since O
her O
last O
visit O
, O
with O
15.4 O
in O
05 O
- O
23.5 O
in O
Theresa O
, O
and O
3.09 O
- O
18 O
. O

Her O
sister O
reports O
that O
the B-TREATMENT
medication I-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
had O
been O
changed O
to O
200 O
mg O
qam O
and O
100 O
mg O
qpm O
in O
Theresa O
, O
and O
a O
review O
of O
her O
Union O
Hospital O
- O
North O
Shore O
Medical O
Center O
records O
indicates O
that O
this O
may O
have O
occurred O
in O
an O
urgent O
care O
appointment O
secondary O
to O
slurred B-SYMPTOM
speech I-SYMPTOM
and O
a O
recent O
fall O
and O
a B-SYMPTOM
non-trough I-SYMPTOM
level I-SYMPTOM
of O
15.9 O
. O

According O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
no B-SYMPTOM
short-term I-SYMPTOM
memory I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
has O
been O
living O
in O
an O
assisted O
living O
facility O
and O
frequently O
calls O
her O
even O
right O
after O
she O
has O
left O
without O
remembering O
her O
visit O
. O

The O
patient O
walks O
with O
a B-TREATMENT
walker I-TREATMENT
at O
baseline O
and O
goes O
out O
for O
dinner O
and O
shopping O
with O
her O
sister O
. O

Ms. O
Swanson O
also O
carries O
a O

of O
" O
atypical B-SYMPTOM
MS I-SYMPTOM

which O
she O
brought O

she O
has O
had O
stable B-SYMPTOM
deficits I-SYMPTOM
for O
many O
years O
without O
any B-SYMPTOM
flare-like I-SYMPTOM
episodes I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
had O
an O
MRI O
in O
2014 O
that O
showed O
multiple B-SYMPTOM
plaque-like I-SYMPTOM
lesions I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
these O
were O
entirely O
stable O
since O
2010 O
. O

She O
is O
not O

yo O

and O
brain B-SYMPTOM

, O
presents O

now O

with O
persistent B-SYMPTOM
twitching I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
arm I-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
face I-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
is O
most O
consistent O
with O
complex B-SYMPTOM
partial I-SYMPTOM
seizures I-SYMPTOM
with O
a O
focus O
in O
the O
left O
hemisphere O
, O
most O
likely O
the O

strip O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
her B-SYMPTOM
seizures I-SYMPTOM
were O
on O
the O
left O
side O
, O
which O
implies O
that O
she O
now O
has O
a O
new O
focus O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
this O
is O
secondary O
to O
her B-SYMPTOM
underlying I-SYMPTOM
demyelinating I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
per O
report O
this O
has O
not O
been O
very O
active O
. O

Other O
possibilities O
include O
infection B-SYMPTOM
, O
including O
her B-SYMPTOM
UTI I-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
these B-SYMPTOM
seizures I-SYMPTOM
began O
due O
to O
subtherapeutic B-SYMPTOM
dilantin I-SYMPTOM
levels I-SYMPTOM
on O
her B-TREATMENT
new I-TREATMENT

200 O

Her B-TREATMENT
seizure I-TREATMENT
management I-TREATMENT
is O
difficult O
, O
given O
the B-TREATMENT
higher I-TREATMENT

were O
causing O
her O

. O

Discussed O
with O
Dr. O
Joaquin O
the O
addition O
of O
an B-TREATMENT
alternate I-TREATMENT
Castelluccio I-TREATMENT
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
tapering O
down O
the B-TREATMENT
dilantin I-TREATMENT
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
he O
agreed O
that O
she O
may O
benefit O
from O
zonegran B-TREATMENT
. O

Cannot O
use O
lamictal B-TREATMENT
or O
depakote B-TREATMENT
due O
to O
reactions B-SYMPTOM
. O

Topamax B-TREATMENT
is O
another O
possibility O
, O
but O
not O
ideal O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
preexisting B-SYMPTOM
cognitive I-SYMPTOM

. O

She O

to O
a O

of O
200 O
mg O
/ O
day O
; O
she O
was O
on O
100 O
mg O
daily O
at O

and O
should O
have O
her O

increased O
on O
10-12 O

again O
on O

. O

She O
was O
continued O
on O

with O

The O
importance O
of O
quitting O
smoking O
as O
well O
as O
continuing O

follow O
his B-TREATMENT
medical I-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
was O
emphasized O
to O
the O

also O
to O
follow O

as O
Dr. O
Lfsquarc O
on O
the O

The O
patient O
remained O
guaiac O

Despite O
being O
on O
heparin B-TREATMENT
for O
a O

only O
a B-SYMPTOM

after O
the B-TREATMENT

He O
will O
need O

an O
out O

, O
as O
mentioned O
above O
, O
she O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
hypotensive I-SYMPTOM
episode I-SYMPTOM
, O
which O
responded O
to O
some B-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
boluses I-TREATMENT

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
day O
prior O

. O

The O
EGD O
did O
show O
three B-SYMPTOM
esophageal I-SYMPTOM
ulcers I-SYMPTOM
that O
were O
localized O
and O
apparent O
suggestion O
of O
pill B-SYMPTOM
esophagitis I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her O
stomach O

4. O
Shortness B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
breath I-SYMPTOM
: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O

did O
develop O
MRSA B-SYMPTOM
pneumonia I-SYMPTOM
that O
was O
started O

be O
treated O
with O
vancomycin B-TREATMENT
and O
she O
did O
also O
develop O
an B-SYMPTOM
oxygen I-SYMPTOM
requirement I-SYMPTOM
the O
day O
prior O
to O

. O

At O
most O
, O
her B-SYMPTOM

, O
she O
was O
satting O
well O
on O
two O
liters O
of O
nasal B-TREATMENT
cannula I-TREATMENT
. O

This O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
her B-SYMPTOM
pneumonia I-SYMPTOM
; O
however O
, O
with O
her B-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
hypokinesis I-SYMPTOM
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
she O
may O
have O
an O
element O
of O
pulmonary B-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
and O
may O
warrant O
further O
investigation O
as O
an O
outpatient O
, O
for O
example O
, O
with O
chest O
CT O
. O

5. O
Derm O
: O

Several O
days O
prior O

, O
the O
patient O
developed O
some B-SYMPTOM
erythematous I-SYMPTOM
rash I-SYMPTOM
under O
her O
left O
breast O
and O
left O
side O
that O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
yeast B-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
some B-TREATMENT
Miconazole I-TREATMENT
Cream I-TREATMENT
. O

The B-SYMPTOM
rash I-SYMPTOM
was O
always O
localized O
to O
her O
left O
side O
, O
sometimes O
extending O
down O
to O
her O
leg O
, O
but O
never O
on O
the O

The B-SYMPTOM
rash I-SYMPTOM
appeared O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
begun O
on O
high B-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
Hydroxyurea I-TREATMENT
, O
with O
a O
gradual O
improvement O
in O
his O
white O
blood O
count O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

He O
did O
spike O
a B-SYMPTOM
fever I-SYMPTOM
and O
began O
Ancef B-TREATMENT
and O
Gentamicin B-TREATMENT
, O
although O
cultures O
never O
revealed O
a O
source O
for O
this O
. O

He O
also O
tried O
Amicar B-TREATMENT
and O
continued O
on O
low B-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
Prednisone I-TREATMENT
. O

His B-SYMPTOM
headache I-SYMPTOM
improved O
, O
but O
her O
remained O
profoundly B-SYMPTOM
weak I-SYMPTOM
and O
intermittently B-SYMPTOM
febrile I-SYMPTOM
with O
dyspnea B-SYMPTOM
. O

There O
was O
hemoptysis B-SYMPTOM
and O
intermittent B-SYMPTOM
gastrointestinal I-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
, O
while O
he O
remained O
profoundly B-SYMPTOM
thrombocytopenia I-SYMPTOM
. O

Transfusions B-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
platelets I-TREATMENT
did O
not O
change O
his O
platelet O
count O
, O
presumably O
because O
of O
sequestration B-SYMPTOM
and O
a B-SYMPTOM
massive I-SYMPTOM
spleen I-SYMPTOM
. O

Amicar B-TREATMENT
was O
of O
uncertain O
value O
, O
but O
used O
intermittently O
. O

A O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
revealed O
the O
transformation O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
CMML I-SYMPTOM
to O
acute B-SYMPTOM
myelogenous I-SYMPTOM
leukemia I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
given O
his B-SYMPTOM
other I-SYMPTOM
underlying I-SYMPTOM
medical I-SYMPTOM
problems I-SYMPTOM
, O
we O
chose O
chemotherapy B-TREATMENT
with O
subcutaneous B-TREATMENT
Cystosine I-TREATMENT
Arabinoside I-TREATMENT
and O
6-Thioguanine B-TREATMENT
, O
which O
he O
tolerated O
without O
incident O
and O
this O
brought O
his O
white O
blood O
count O
down O
to O
below O
1,000 O
, O
and O
his O
spleen O
shrank O
noticeably O
, O
but O
he O
still O
could O
not O
maintain O
a O
bump O
in O
platelet O
count O
with O
platelet B-TREATMENT
transfusions I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
was O
intermittently B-SYMPTOM
congested I-SYMPTOM
limiting O
our O
ability O
to O
give O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
, O
for O
his B-TREATMENT
hydrea I-TREATMENT
, O
although O
we O
kept O
him O
on O
Allopurinol B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
renal O
function O
deteriorated O
somewhat O
, O
hampering O
our O
ability O
to O
give O
him O
his B-TREATMENT
Gentamicin I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
family O
maintained O
an O
extraordinary O
vigil O
over O
the O
days O
of O
his O
hospitalization O
, O
providing O
him O
with O
some O
food O
and O
constant O
attention O
, O
while O
we O
awaited O
the O
results O
of O
his B-TREATMENT
chemotherapy I-TREATMENT
and O
treatment B-TREATMENT
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
infection I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
intermittently B-SYMPTOM
restless I-SYMPTOM
and O
somewhat B-SYMPTOM
confused I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
as O
his O
respiratory O
status O
deteriorated O
, O
the O
family O
agreed O
to O
a B-TREATMENT
low I-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
Morphine I-TREATMENT
drip I-TREATMENT
which O
made O
him O
much O
more O
comfortable O
. O

They O
agreed O
with O
a O

a O
relatively O
short O

the O
Intensive O

Unit O
. O

Throughout O
this O
time O
, O
her O
creatinine O
continued O

no O
apparent B-SYMPTOM
deleterious I-SYMPTOM
effect I-SYMPTOM
on O
her B-TREATMENT
transplant I-TREATMENT
from O
this O
episode O
. O

Her B-TREATMENT

systolic I-SYMPTOM
function I-SYMPTOM
with O
severe B-SYMPTOM

a B-SYMPTOM
small I-SYMPTOM
myocardial I-SYMPTOM

. O

Clinically O
, O
she O
did O
much O
better O

also O
felt O
that O
lung O
biopsy O
at O
this O
time O
was O
rather O
risky O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
therefore O
completely O
cultured O
again O
and O
begun O
on O
antibiotic B-TREATMENT
coverage I-TREATMENT
which O
would O
take O
care O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
Pseudomonas I-SYMPTOM
he O
was O
known O
to O
have O
. O

The B-TREATMENT
steroids I-TREATMENT
were O
tapered O
. O

He O
was O
also O
begun O
on O
anti-Candida B-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
for O
his B-SYMPTOM
urinary I-SYMPTOM
tract I-SYMPTOM
infection I-SYMPTOM
with O
yeast B-SYMPTOM
being O
seen O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
story O
of O
hemoptysis B-SYMPTOM
, O
he O
also O
underwent O
an O
exotic O
bleeding O
work O
up O
for O
such O
things O
as O
Wegner B-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
and O
Goodpasture B-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
. O

These O
results O
were O
all O
negative O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
require O
very B-TREATMENT
high I-TREATMENT
FIO2 I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
DVT I-SYMPTOM
by O
ultrasound O
. O

He O
underwent O
a B-TREATMENT
trial I-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
TPA I-TREATMENT
followed O
by O
heparin B-TREATMENT
. O

This O
produced O
substantially B-SYMPTOM
further I-SYMPTOM
hemoptysis I-SYMPTOM
and O
the O
need O
for O
transfusion B-TREATMENT
. O

He O
stabilized O
from O
this O
, O
but O
on O
the O
fifth O
while O
continuing O
to O
have O
extremely B-SYMPTOM
ventilator I-SYMPTOM
requirement I-SYMPTOM
. O

In O
consultation O
with O
his O
family O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
enough O
support O
had O
been O
done O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
therefore O
, O
ventilator B-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
was O
withdrawn O

1. O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
complaints O
of O
dyspnea B-SYMPTOM
on O
exertion O
and O
chest B-SYMPTOM
pressure I-SYMPTOM
which O
could O
be O
consistent O
with O
angina B-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
given O
the O
long O
duration O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
symptoms I-SYMPTOM
and O
negative O
workup O
in O
the O
past O
, O
it O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
unlikely O
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
an B-TREATMENT
aspirin I-TREATMENT
as O
well O
as O
a B-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
a O
rule O
out O
myocardial O
infarction O
protocol O
was O
initiated O
. O

A O
stress O
thallium O
was O
planned O
for O
the O
day O
following O
admission O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
night O
of O
admission O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
lying O
in O
her O
bed O
diaphoretic B-SYMPTOM
and O
obtunded B-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
a O
code O
was O
called O
. O

Further O
examination O
revealed O
a O
strong O
palpable O
pulse O
with O
a O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
in O
the O
130 O
s O
and O
a O
heart O
rate O
in O
the O
80 O
s. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
minutes O
the O
patient O
became O
increasingly O
more O
responsive O
. O

She O
was O
treated O
with O
a B-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
bolus I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
quickly O
responded O
to O
a B-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
bolus I-TREATMENT
and O
became O
interactive O
. O

She O
reported O
that O
she O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
commode O
urinating O
and O
began O
to O
feel O
nauseous B-SYMPTOM
and O
presyncopal B-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
was O
able O
to O
get O
to O
bed O
at O
which O
point O
she O
passed O
out O
. O

She O
denied O
any B-SYMPTOM
chest I-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
or O
pressure B-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
no O
shortness B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
breath I-SYMPTOM
during O
this O
event O
. O

A O
rhythm O
check O
obtained O
during O
the O
time O
of O
this O
event O
demonstrated O
a B-SYMPTOM
pause I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
six I-SYMPTOM
seconds I-SYMPTOM
followed O
by O
a B-SYMPTOM
junctional I-SYMPTOM
escape I-SYMPTOM
rhythm I-SYMPTOM
. O

An O
electrocardiogram O
obtained O
after O
the O
code O
demonstrated O
no O
acute B-SYMPTOM
changes I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her B-SYMPTOM
acute I-SYMPTOM
bradycardic I-SYMPTOM
event I-SYMPTOM
was O
felt O
likely O
secondary O
to O
her B-TREATMENT
new I-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
in O
conjunction O
with O
a B-SYMPTOM
vagal I-SYMPTOM
response I-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
was O
determined O
to O
stop O
the B-TREATMENT
beta I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
atropine B-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
at O
the O
bedside O
. O

On O
the O
following O
day O
the O
patient O
underwent O
an O
echocardiogram O
which O
demonstrated O
dilated B-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
ventricle I-SYMPTOM
secondary O
to O
chronic B-SYMPTOM
dysfunction I-SYMPTOM
and O
a O
pulmonary O
artery O
pressure O
of O
greater O
than O
100 O
. O

Her O
stress O
test O
was O
cancelled O
. O

A O
CT O
angiogram O
was O
ordered O
to O
evaluate O
for O
chronic B-SYMPTOM
thromboembolic I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
as O
a O
potential O
cause O
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
was O
ruled O
out O
for O
myocardial B-SYMPTOM
infarction I-SYMPTOM
with O
three O
sets O
of O
normal O
enzymes O
and O
continued O
to O
be O
monitored O
on O
telemetry O
. O

A O
Pulmonary O
consultation O
was O
obtained O
to O
evaluate O
for O
possible O
etiology O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
hypotension I-SYMPTOM
. O

There O
was O
little O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
any B-SYMPTOM
cardiac I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
given O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
Grave's I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
an B-SYMPTOM
autoimmune I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
was O
felt O
to O
be O
possible O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
consideration O
was O
given O
to O
sarcoidosis B-SYMPTOM
, O
human B-SYMPTOM
immunodeficiency I-SYMPTOM
virus I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
drug-induced O
given O
her O
history O
of O
herbal B-TREATMENT
medication I-TREATMENT
use O
. O

It O
was O
recommended O
that O
the O
patient O
begin O
anticoagulation B-TREATMENT
given O
the O
severity O
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
was O
also O
planned O
to O
undergo O
a O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
with O
a O
vasodilation O
trial O
by O
the O
catheterization O
laboratory O
. O

A O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
was O
performed O
on O
2014-12-05 O
. O

A O
pharmacologic O
pulmonary O
vasodilator O
challenge O
was O
performed O
with O
a O
positive O
response O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a O
CT O
angiogram O
of O
the O
chest O
with O
pulmonary O
embolism O
protocol O
showed O
no O
intravascular B-SYMPTOM
filling I-SYMPTOM
defect I-SYMPTOM
but O
did O
show O
a B-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
upper I-SYMPTOM
lobe I-SYMPTOM
ground-glass I-SYMPTOM
and O
scattered B-SYMPTOM
adenopathy I-SYMPTOM
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
the O
end O
left B-SYMPTOM
atrial I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
was O
essentially O
ruled O
out O
as O
a O
primary O
cause O
. O

Chronic B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
embolus I-SYMPTOM
was O
less O
likely O
given O
her O
negative O
CT O
angiogram O
. O

Chronic B-SYMPTOM
lung I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
was O
unlikely O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
normal O
pulmonary O
function O
tests O
and O
DLCO O
in O
2012 O
as O
well O
as O
a O
normal O
CT O
angiogram O
. O

Collagen B-SYMPTOM
vascular I-SYMPTOM
disease I-SYMPTOM
could O
not O
be O
definitively O
ruled O
out O
; O
however O
, O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
lack O
of O
connective B-SYMPTOM
tissue I-SYMPTOM
disorder I-SYMPTOM
stigmata I-SYMPTOM
it O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
less O
likely O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
's O
human O
immunodeficiency O
virus O
test O
was O
negative O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
most O
likely O
experiencing O
a B-SYMPTOM
primary I-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
. O

Consideration O
was O
given O
to O
treating O
the O
patient O
with O
a O
course O
of O
calcium B-TREATMENT
channel I-TREATMENT
blocker I-TREATMENT
; O
however O
, O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
poor O
response O
to O
Lopressor B-TREATMENT
, O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
this O
would O
not O
be O
optimal O
treatment O
for O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
. O

Therefore O
, O
her O
insurance O
company O
was O
contacted O
regarding O
the O
potential O
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
as O
a O
treatment O
. O

Plans O
were O
made O
for O
placement O
of O
a B-TREATMENT
Hickman I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
and O
initiation O
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
treatment I-TREATMENT
. O

However O
, O
on O
12-07 O
, O
the O
patient O
once O
again O
experienced O
an O
episode O
of O
unresponsiveness B-SYMPTOM
. O

Upon O
arrival O
by O
the O
physician O
the O
patient O
was O
awake O
, O
alert O
, O
and O
oriented O
with O
a O
pulse O
in O
the O
80 O
s, O
with O
pressure O
in O
the O
80 O
s, O
and O
satting O
100% O
on O
room O
air O
. O

She O
described O
this O
episode O
as O
an B-SYMPTOM
uncomfortable I-SYMPTOM
feeling I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
her I-SYMPTOM
chest I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
2 O
liters O
of O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
fluids I-TREATMENT
with O
a O
bump O
in O
her O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
to O
the O
90 O
s. O

Review O
of O
telemetry O
revealed O
an O
8 O
to O
9 O
beat O
episode O
of O
nonsustained B-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
tachycardia I-SYMPTOM
followed O
by O
an O
episode O
of O
bradycardia B-SYMPTOM
to O
60 O
beats O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
etiology O
of O
these B-SYMPTOM
cardiovascular I-SYMPTOM
episodes I-SYMPTOM
was O
unclear O
, O
but O
was O
felt O
likely O
secondary O
to O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
tenuous I-SYMPTOM
cardiovascular I-SYMPTOM
status I-SYMPTOM
given O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
had O
clear B-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
, O
was O
very B-SYMPTOM
preload I-SYMPTOM
dependent I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
had O
an O
intact O
left O
ventricular O
function O
but O
with O
cardiac B-SYMPTOM
output I-SYMPTOM
limited I-SYMPTOM
due O
to O
left B-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
compression I-SYMPTOM
by O
a B-SYMPTOM
dilated I-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
ventricle I-SYMPTOM
. O

Given O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
persistent I-SYMPTOM
hypotensive I-SYMPTOM
episodes I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
decreased B-SYMPTOM
urine I-SYMPTOM
output I-SYMPTOM
, O
she O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
for O
management O
prior O
to O
initiation O
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
. O

On O
12-08 O
, O
the B-TREATMENT
Hickman I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
in O
preparation O
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
administration O
. O

During O
the O
Mass. O
Mental O
Health O
Center O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
exquisitely B-SYMPTOM
preload I-SYMPTOM
dependent I-SYMPTOM
and O
responded O
well O
to O
aggressive B-TREATMENT
fluids I-TREATMENT
as O
needed O
to O
maintain O
her O
blood O
pressure O
with O
a O
systolic O
of O
greater O
than O
90 O
. O

She O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia B-SYMPTOM
during O
her O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
's O
urine O
output O
improved O
dramatically O
with O
hydration B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
, O
suggesting O
her B-SYMPTOM
low I-SYMPTOM
urine I-SYMPTOM
output I-SYMPTOM
was O
secondary O
to O
decreased B-SYMPTOM
cardiac I-SYMPTOM
output I-SYMPTOM
secondary O
to O
low B-SYMPTOM
preload I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
Electrophysiology O
Service O
, O
who O
determined O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
demonstrating O
severe B-SYMPTOM
vasal I-SYMPTOM
sensitivity I-SYMPTOM
with O
bradycardia B-SYMPTOM
necessitating O
pacemaker B-TREATMENT
placement I-TREATMENT
. O

This O
was O
to O
be O
deferred O
until O
after O
the O
patient O
had O
her B-TREATMENT
Hickman I-TREATMENT
in O
place O
. O

Because O
the O
patient O
's O
pulmonary O
pressures O
responded O
so O
well O
to O
adenosine B-TREATMENT
during O
right O
heart O
catheterization O
, O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
be O
a O
good O
candidate O
for O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
. O

Flolan B-TREATMENT
was O
initiated O
on O
12-08 O
at O
5 O
nanograms O
per O
kilogram O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
monitored O
for O
symptoms B-SYMPTOM
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
including O
nausea B-SYMPTOM
, O
vomiting B-SYMPTOM
, O
first B-SYMPTOM
bite I-SYMPTOM
jaw I-SYMPTOM
claudication I-SYMPTOM
, O
or O
hypotension B-SYMPTOM
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
hospital O
stay O
the B-TREATMENT
patient I-TREATMENT
's I-TREATMENT
Flolan I-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
was O
titrated O
to O
receive O
maximum O
benefit O
without O
precipitating O
symptoms O
of O
Flolan B-SYMPTOM
overdose I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
stable O
on O
her B-TREATMENT
current I-TREATMENT
Flolan I-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
and O
was O
therefore O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

A O
high O
resolution O
CT O
was O
requested O
to O
further O
evaluate O
for O
possible O
secondary O
cause O
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
primary I-SYMPTOM
pulmonary I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
; O
however O
, O
the O
patient O
refused O
it O
at O
this O
time O
. O

Plans O
for O
placement O
of O
a B-TREATMENT
pacemaker I-TREATMENT
were O
initiated O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
night O
prior O
to O
the O
planned O
surgical O
date O
the O
patient O
suffered O
an O
episode O
of O
bleeding B-SYMPTOM
from O
her B-TREATMENT
Hickman I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
site O
. O

Surgery O
was O
notified O
and O
pressure B-TREATMENT
was O
applied O
; O
however O
, O
it O
did O
not O
stop O
oozing O
. O

A B-TREATMENT
surgicel I-TREATMENT
dressing I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
and O
prolonged B-TREATMENT
pressure I-TREATMENT
resulted O
in O
resolution O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
. O

In O
addition O
, O
an B-TREATMENT
extra I-TREATMENT
stitch I-TREATMENT
was O
placed O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
stop O
the B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
. O

Following O
this O
episode O
the O
patient O
felt O
like O
she O
was O
" O
too B-SYMPTOM
stressed I-SYMPTOM
" O
for O
pacemaker B-TREATMENT
placement I-TREATMENT
. O

Therefore O
, O
she O
was O
monitored O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
for O
any B-SYMPTOM
further I-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
events I-SYMPTOM
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
days O
the O
patient O
became O
more O
accustomed O
to O
her B-TREATMENT
Flolan I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
teaching O
was O
continued O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
occasional O
episodes O
of O
dizziness B-SYMPTOM
, O
shortness B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
breath I-SYMPTOM
, O
and O
hypotension B-SYMPTOM
whenever O
the O
alarm O
sounded O
suggesting O
that O
the B-TREATMENT
Flolan I-TREATMENT
bag I-TREATMENT
needed O
to O
be O
changed O
. O

However O
, O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
hospital O
stay O
these O
decreased O
both O
in O
frequency O
and O
severity O
. O

On O
12-15 O
, O
the O
patient O
went O
for O
placement O
of O
a B-TREATMENT
pacemaker I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
had O
dual-mode B-TREATMENT
, I-TREATMENT
dual-pacing I-TREATMENT
, I-TREATMENT
dual-sensing I-TREATMENT
pacemaker I-TREATMENT
placed O
with O
a O
lower O
rate O
at O
60 O

, O
and O
upper O
rate O
of O
120 O
ppm O
with O
a O
paced O
AV O
of O
150 O
msec O
. O

The O
patient O
recovered O
well O
from O
her B-TREATMENT
surgery I-TREATMENT
for O
pacemaker B-TREATMENT
placement I-TREATMENT
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
tolerating O
her B-TREATMENT
Flolan I-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
well O
. O

She O
had O
received O
a O
full O
course O
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
teaching I-TREATMENT
and O
reported O
that O
she O
and O
her O
husband O
felt O
comfortable O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
medication I-TREATMENT
at O
home O
. O

She O
was O
set O
up O
with O
a B-TREATMENT
primary I-TREATMENT
pulmonary I-TREATMENT
hypertension I-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
group I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
home B-TREATMENT
services I-TREATMENT
were O
arranged O
to O
help O
her O
in O
the O
initiation O
of O
Flolan B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
. O

Following O
pacemaker B-TREATMENT
placement I-TREATMENT
the O
patient O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia B-SYMPTOM
on O
telemetry O
, O
and O
therefore O
she O
was O
discharged O
in O
satisfactory O
condition O
. O

2. O
INFECTIOUS O
DISEASE O
: O

The O
patient O
had O
no O
signs O
or O
symptoms O
of O
infection B-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
. O

However O
, O
she O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
relatively I-SYMPTOM
elevated I-SYMPTOM
white I-SYMPTOM
blood I-SYMPTOM
cell I-SYMPTOM
count I-SYMPTOM
that O
remained O
stable O
over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
hospital O
stay O
. O

However O
, O
near O
the O
end O
of O
her O
hospitalization O
the O
patient O
began O
describing O
increased B-SYMPTOM
urinary I-SYMPTOM
frequency I-SYMPTOM
which O
persisted O
once O
her B-TREATMENT
Foley I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
was O
removed O
. O

A O
urinalysis O
was O
positive B-SYMPTOM
and O
urine O
culture O
grew O
enterococcus B-SYMPTOM
which O
was O
pan O
sensitive O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
levofloxacin B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
to O
complete O
a O
10 O
- O
day O
course O
. O

Following O
initiation O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
antibiotic I-TREATMENT
the O
patient O
's O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
quickly O
came O
down O
, O
and O
she O
remained O
afebrile B-SYMPTOM
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
still O

which O
showed O
a B-SYMPTOM
retrotracheal I-SYMPTOM
mass I-SYMPTOM
that O
appeared O
to O
obliterate O
the O
esophagus O
. O

This O
raised O

. O

It O
was O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Ms. O
Shuffa O
underwent O
an O
EGD O
and O
flexible O
bronchoscopy O
on O
9/16/00 O
shortly O
after O
she O
arrived O
. O

This O
showed O
tracheal B-SYMPTOM
compressions I-SYMPTOM
but O
no O
other B-SYMPTOM
lesions I-SYMPTOM
that O
were O
obvious O
at O
the O
time O
. O

She O
was O
hemodynamically O
stable O
and O
remained O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
ventilator I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
differential O
diagnoses O
at O
this O
point O
consisted O
of O
hematoma B-SYMPTOM
vs. O
neoplasm B-SYMPTOM
vs. O
an B-SYMPTOM
abscess I-SYMPTOM
vs. O
a B-SYMPTOM
thyroid I-SYMPTOM
tumor I-SYMPTOM
. O

On O
9/22/00 O
, O
she O
underwent O
a O
cervical O
mediastinoscopy O
. O

A O
biopsy O
of O
this B-SYMPTOM
mass I-SYMPTOM
was O
consistent O
with O
hematoma B-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
operative O
report O
shows O
that O
there O
was O
an B-SYMPTOM
abnormal I-SYMPTOM
area I-SYMPTOM
below I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
trachea I-SYMPTOM
to O
the O
left O
which O
represented O
a O
cavity O
between O
the O
esophagus O
, O
trachea O
, O
aorta O
, O
and O
spine O
that O
was O
full O
of O
clot B-SYMPTOM
. O

There O
was O
no O
active B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
time O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
several O
days O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
hemodynamically O
stable O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
ventilator I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
had O
an B-SYMPTOM
elevated I-SYMPTOM
calcium I-SYMPTOM
level I-SYMPTOM
that O
raised O
the O
suspicion O
that O
this B-SYMPTOM
mass I-SYMPTOM
could O
be O
a B-SYMPTOM
hematoma I-SYMPTOM
coming O
from O
a B-SYMPTOM
ruptured I-SYMPTOM
parathyroid I-SYMPTOM
adenoma I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
ionized O
calcium O
was O
elevated B-SYMPTOM
as O
was O
the O
parathormone O
level O
. O

Given O
these O
findings O
, O
she O
underwent O
a O
Sestamibi O
scan O
. O

The O
Sestamibi O
scan O
showed O
findings O
that O
were O
consistent O
with O
a B-SYMPTOM
parathyroid I-SYMPTOM
adenoma I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
lobe I-SYMPTOM
of O
the O
thyroid O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
it O
was O
believed O
that O
her B-SYMPTOM
clot I-SYMPTOM
was O
due O
to O
a B-SYMPTOM
rupture I-SYMPTOM
of O
this B-SYMPTOM
parathyroid I-SYMPTOM
adenoma I-SYMPTOM
. O

Dr. O
Ear O
brought O
the O
patient O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
10/5/00 O
. O

She O
underwent O
a O
parathyroid O
exploration O
with O
resection B-TREATMENT
of O
a B-SYMPTOM
ruptured I-SYMPTOM
ectopic I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
upper I-SYMPTOM
parathyroid I-SYMPTOM
adenoma I-SYMPTOM
, O
a O
biopsy O
of O
a O

, O
resection B-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
a I-TREATMENT
left I-TREATMENT
upper I-TREATMENT
parathyroid I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
tracheostomy B-TREATMENT
. O

She O
tolerated O
the B-TREATMENT
procedure I-TREATMENT
well O
and O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
with O
her B-TREATMENT
new I-TREATMENT
tracheostomy I-TREATMENT
working O
well O
. O

Her O
postoperative O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
serosanguineous B-SYMPTOM
pleural I-SYMPTOM
effusion I-SYMPTOM
on I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
. O

This O
required O
a B-TREATMENT
chest I-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
. O

Her O
hematocrit O
continued O
to O
drop O
over O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
days O
despite O
normal O
platelet O
count O
, O
normal O
coags O
, O
and O
no O
obvious O
source O
of O
bleeding B-SYMPTOM
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
she O
was O
continuing O
to O
bleed B-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
her I-SYMPTOM
chest I-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
we O
are O
not O
quite O
sure O
why O
this O
was O
occurring O
. O

She O
underwent O
an O
extensive O
workup O
by O
Hematology O
that O
revealed O
a B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
diatheses I-SYMPTOM
of O
unknown O
etiology O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O

She O
has O
a O

is O
present O
for O
approximately O
12 O

. O

She O
has O
been O
very O
helpful O
in O

seems O
to O
say O
that O
Ms. O

She O
occasionally O
gets O
hypertensive B-SYMPTOM
when O
she O
is O
agitated B-SYMPTOM
. O

For O
this O
, O
we O
have O
given O
her O
10 O
mg O
of O
hydralazine B-TREATMENT
. O

Her O
blood O

responds O
well O
to O
this O

Otherwise O
, O
she O
is O
in O
normal O
sinus O

and O
has O
been O
hemodynamically O
stable O
throughout O
her O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
a B-SYMPTOM

pseudoaneurysm I-SYMPTOM
after O

This O

Ot O
of O

. O

The B-SYMPTOM
aneurysm I-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
time O
of O

is O
approximately O
2.5 O
cm O
. O

They O
elected O
not O
to O
inject O
it O
with O
thrombin B-TREATMENT
. O

They O
asked O
that O
the O
patient O
follow-up O
with O
Dr. O
Ear O
in O
approximately O
three O
to O
four O
weeks O
so O
that O
this B-SYMPTOM
aneurysm I-SYMPTOM
can O
be O
assessed O
. O

They O
have O
opted O
for O
conservative O
management O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O

remained O
on O
CPAP B-TREATMENT
with O
a B-TREATMENT
PEEP I-TREATMENT
of O
7.5 O
and O
a B-TREATMENT
pressure I-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
of O

She O
seems O
to O
be O
tolerating O
this O
well O
as O
she O
has O
an O
O2 O
sat O
of O
100% O
on O
40% B-TREATMENT

Her O
chest O

shows O
a B-SYMPTOM

lower I-SYMPTOM

hematoma I-SYMPTOM
that O
had O
greatly O
improved O
in O
the O

. O

Her O
right O
lung O

is O
clear O
. O

Her B-TREATMENT
tracheostomy I-TREATMENT
is O
functioning O
well O
, O
and O
we O
have O
had O
no O
problems B-SYMPTOM
with O
it O
. O

She O
will O
obviously O
need O
to O
be O
weaned O
as O
tolerated O
. O

We O
had O
her O
down O
to O
a B-TREATMENT
low I-TREATMENT
pressure I-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
of O
7 O
in O
the O
last O
week O
. O

With O
the B-TREATMENT
pressure I-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
at O
7 O
, O
she O
became O
tachypneic B-SYMPTOM
and O
had O
to O
be O
brought O
back O
up O
to O
10 O
. O

Her O
oxygen O
saturation O
has O
always O
been O
good O

The O

of O
full B-TREATMENT

Jevity I-TREATMENT
of O
75 O

This O
is O
her O
goal O
. O

She O
tolerates O
them O
very O
well O
and O
has O
approximately O
200 O
cc O
to O
300 O
cc O
of O
stool O
per O

Last O
week O
, O
she O
had O
copious B-SYMPTOM

in O
the O
range O
of O
500 O

for O
C. B-SYMPTOM
difficile I-SYMPTOM

. O

These O
have O
all O
been O
negative O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
this O
was O
an B-SYMPTOM
osmotic I-SYMPTOM
diarrhea I-SYMPTOM
. O

Since O
her B-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
feeds I-TREATMENT
have O
been O
changed O
from O
full B-TREATMENT
strength I-TREATMENT
Nephro I-TREATMENT
to O
Jevity B-TREATMENT
, O
her B-SYMPTOM
diarrhea I-SYMPTOM
has O
resolved O

She O
has O
been O
taking O
Zantac B-TREATMENT

and O
the O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
hypernatremia B-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
is O
approximately O
10 O
kg O
up O
her O
overall O
body O
weight O
. O

We O
believe O
her O
to O
still O
be O
total B-SYMPTOM
body I-SYMPTOM
overloaded I-SYMPTOM
. O

Over O
the O
last O
several O
days O
, O
we O
have O
been O
giving O
her O
approximately O
500 O
cc O
to O
1000 O
cc O
of O
free B-TREATMENT
water I-TREATMENT
through O
her B-TREATMENT
NG I-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
. O

We O
also O
have O
been O
diuresing O
her O
with O
Bumex B-TREATMENT
. O

This O
seems O
to O
trend O
her O
sodium O
down O
. O

This O
will O
need O
to O
be O
monitored O
closely O
. O

Her O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
have O
been O
normal O
, O
and O
she O
has O
always O
made O
good O
urine O
. O

6. O
Heme O
. O

As O
stated O
before O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
ooze O
into O
her O
pleural O
space O
well O
after O
her B-TREATMENT
definitive I-TREATMENT
operation I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
had O
an O
extensive O
workup O
by O
Hematology O
which O
revealed O
a B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
diathesis I-SYMPTOM
of O
unknown O
origin O
. O

Before O
we O
removed O
her B-TREATMENT
chest I-TREATMENT
tube I-TREATMENT
, O
we O
had O
to O
give O
her B-TREATMENT
platelets I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
had O
no O
problems B-SYMPTOM
with O
this O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
her O
hematocrit O
is O
stable O
in O
the O
28 O
to O
33 O
range O
. O

I O
stress O
that O
she O
cannot O
be O
anticoagulated B-TREATMENT
. O

We O
have O
given O
her B-TREATMENT
Lovenox I-TREATMENT
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
she O
continues O
to O
bleed O
. O

Therefore O
, O
she O
is O
on O
no O
DVT B-TREATMENT
prophylaxis I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
does O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
iliac I-SYMPTOM
deep I-SYMPTOM
vein I-SYMPTOM
thrombosis I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
has O
a B-TREATMENT

, O
and O
this O
is O
her O
only O
DVT B-TREATMENT

At O
the O
time O
of O

, O
the O
patient O
has O
a B-SYMPTOM

She O

she O

This O
is O
also O

We O

Since O
she O
was O
at O
high O
risk O
for O
both O
local B-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
metastatic I-SYMPTOM
recurrence I-SYMPTOM
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
tumor I-SYMPTOM
, O
she O
received O
both O
systemic B-TREATMENT
chemotherapy I-TREATMENT
and O
radiation B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
CMSAP B-TREATMENT

four O
cycles O
. O

There O
were O
no O

However O
, O
following O
cycle O

, O
she O
developed O
a B-SYMPTOM
flu-like I-SYMPTOM
illness I-SYMPTOM
, O
followed O
by O
fever B-SYMPTOM

The O
differential O
diagnosis O
included O
viral B-SYMPTOM
pneumonitis I-SYMPTOM
, O
Mycoplasma B-SYMPTOM

Basically O
in O
December O
1993 O
, O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
Hem O

Onc O
Clinic O
with O
chest B-SYMPTOM

nodules I-SYMPTOM
which O
turned O
out O
to O

Although O
she O
had O
mediastinal B-SYMPTOM

CT O
were O
negative O

She O
also O
developed O
Klebsiella B-SYMPTOM
UTI I-SYMPTOM
after O
the O
second O
cycle O
of O
high B-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
chemotherapy I-TREATMENT
. O

It O
was O
treated O
with O
gent B-TREATMENT

In O
May O
1994 O
she O
received O
her O
first O
course O
of O
thiotepa B-TREATMENT
and O
Velban B-TREATMENT
and O
Methotrexate B-TREATMENT
, O
which O
required O
some B-TREATMENT

In O
mid O
May O
she O
was O
admitted O
for O
fever B-SYMPTOM

In O
summary O
, O
the O
patient O
is O
a O
49 O
year O
old O
woman O
with O
metastatic B-SYMPTOM
breast I-SYMPTOM
cell I-SYMPTOM
CA I-SYMPTOM
, O
status O
post O
chemotherapy B-TREATMENT
with O
CMSAP B-TREATMENT
and O
PVSC B-TREATMENT
and O
XRT B-TREATMENT
who O
presented O
with O
fever B-SYMPTOM
, O
four O
days O
of O
diarrhea B-SYMPTOM
, O
nausea B-SYMPTOM
and O
vomiting B-SYMPTOM
and O
had O
been O
on O
Keflex B-TREATMENT
for O
an B-SYMPTOM
erythema I-SYMPTOM
on I-SYMPTOM
her I-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
chest I-SYMPTOM
wall I-SYMPTOM
. O

The B-TREATMENT
Keflex I-TREATMENT
was O
stopped O
when O
she O
developed O
the B-SYMPTOM
diarrhea I-SYMPTOM
. O

When O
she O
arrived O
the O
plan O
was O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
treat O
here B-SYMPTOM
rythematous I-SYMPTOM
induration I-SYMPTOM
and O
possible O
cellulitis B-SYMPTOM
with O
IV B-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
. O

So O
she O
was O
put O
on O
dicloxicillin B-TREATMENT
and O
we O
did O
local B-TREATMENT
wound I-TREATMENT
care I-TREATMENT
with O
an B-TREATMENT
agent I-TREATMENT
called O
Santyl B-TREATMENT
, O
which O
is O
a B-TREATMENT
collagenace I-TREATMENT
ondebrided I-TREATMENT
which O
worked O
very O
well O
for O
her O
. O

Also O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
we O
were O
also O
considering O
palliative B-TREATMENT
Taxol I-TREATMENT
chemotherapy I-TREATMENT
, O
which O
the O
patient O
declined O
. O

She O
refused O
the B-TREATMENT
Taxol I-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
so O
that O
was O
not O
done O
. O

Another O
major O
issue O
with O
this O
patient O
was O
pain B-TREATMENT
control I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
had O
been O
in O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
pain B-SYMPTOM
from O
her B-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
arm I-SYMPTOM
lesion I-SYMPTOM
. O

So O
pain B-TREATMENT
control I-TREATMENT
was O
a O
big O
issue O
so O
she O
was O
on O
MS B-TREATMENT
Contin I-TREATMENT
and O
MSIR B-TREATMENT
at O
home O
she O
thought O
that O
clouded O
her O
thinking O
, O
so O
we O
tried O
different O
things O
for O
pain B-TREATMENT
management I-TREATMENT
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
to O
do O
a B-TREATMENT
subarachnoid I-TREATMENT
neurologic I-TREATMENT
block I-TREATMENT
at I-TREATMENT
C6-C7 I-TREATMENT
interface I-TREATMENT
on O
1-6-94 O
. O

After O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
minimal O
relief O
of O
pain B-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
she O
declined O
further B-TREATMENT
blocks I-TREATMENT
, O
which O
were O
offered O
to O
her O
. O

So O
accepted O
to O
be O
on O
dilaudid B-TREATMENT
p.o. I-TREATMENT
which O
was O
started O
at O
a O
dosage O
of O
2-4 O
meg O
but O
since O
then O
we O
have O
tapered O
it O
up O
. O

She O
is O
now O
getting O
dilaudid B-TREATMENT
8 O
mg O
q2h O
and O
in O
addition O
she O
has O
been O
on O
fentanyl B-TREATMENT
patch I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
is O
now O
getting O
75 O
micrograms O
per O
hour O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
fentanyl I-TREATMENT
patch I-TREATMENT
which O
is O
changed O
every O
72 O
hours O
. O

We O
can O
go O
up O
by O
25 O
mg O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
fentanyl I-TREATMENT
patch I-TREATMENT
as O
needed O
to O
control O
her B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
and O
we O
can O
always O
go O
up O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
dilaudid I-TREATMENT
because O
she O
is O
still O
in O
considerable O
amount O
of O
pain B-SYMPTOM
. O

Other O
things O
that O
happened O
during O
this O
admission O
- O
we O
obtained O
ahead O
CT O
for O
her O
on O
the O
8th O
of O
January O
because O
of O
her B-SYMPTOM
clouded I-SYMPTOM
thinking I-SYMPTOM
and O
altered B-SYMPTOM
mental I-SYMPTOM
status I-SYMPTOM
, O
which O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
the B-TREATMENT
morphine I-TREATMENT
that O
she O
was O
taking O
. O

We O
went O
ahead O
and O
got O
a O
head O
CT O
scanand O
it O
showed O
no O
enhancing B-SYMPTOM
lesions I-SYMPTOM
. O

In O
addition O
her O
liver O
transaminases O
were O
elevated B-SYMPTOM
, O
we O
thought O
about O
doing O
further O
work-up O
, O
but O
that O
was O
deferred O
because O
the O
patient O
wanted O
to O
wait O
on O
that O
. O

That O
has O
been O
stable O
. O

The O
patient O
on O
January O
13 O
became O
hyponatremic B-SYMPTOM
. O

Her O
sodium O
went O
down O
to O
121 O
and O
before O
that O
on O
admission O
she O
was O
133 O
. O

A O
renal O
consult O
was O
obtained O
and O
their O
assessment O
was O
that O
this O
was O
probably O
a O
mixture O
of O
hypovolemia B-SYMPTOM
as O
well O
as O
SIADH B-SYMPTOM
. O

We O
proceeded O
to O
do O
for O
her B-SYMPTOM
hyponatremia I-SYMPTOM
- O
we O
gave O
her O
some B-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
and O
her O
urine O
sodium O
became O
higher O
than O
her O
serum O
sodium O
; O
we O
stopped O
it O
. O

We O
had O
given O
her O
some B-TREATMENT
normal I-TREATMENT
saline I-TREATMENT
and O
then O
we O
proceeded O
to O
just O
do O
fluid B-TREATMENT
restriction I-TREATMENT
. O

In O
addition O
we O
gave O
her O
a B-TREATMENT
sodium I-TREATMENT
chloride I-TREATMENT
one O
gram O
per O
day O
and O
that O
also O
helped O
, O
so O
that O
now O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
sodium O
is O
between O
126 O
and O
129 O
; O
prior O
to O
that O
it O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
as O
low O
116. O

So O
that O
has O
really O
improved O
. O

We O
suggest O
continuing O
increased B-TREATMENT
salt I-TREATMENT
intake I-TREATMENT
in O
her O
diet O
and O
also O
continuing O
with O
the B-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
restriction I-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
free I-TREATMENT
water I-TREATMENT
intake I-TREATMENT
to O
one O
liter O
per O
day O
. O

On O
the O
14th O
of O
January O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
increased B-SYMPTOM
shortness I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
breath I-SYMPTOM
and O
chest O
x-ray O
was O
taken O
showed O
a B-SYMPTOM
wedge I-SYMPTOM
shaped I-SYMPTOM
infiltrate I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
upper I-SYMPTOM
lobe I-SYMPTOM
which O
was O
consistent O
with O
Hampton B-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
hump I-SYMPTOM
. O

Also O
a O
VQ O
scan O
obtained O
the O
next O
day O
showed O
high O
probability O
for O
PE B-SYMPTOM
. O

So O
we O
proceeded O
to O
put O
her O
on O
heparin B-TREATMENT
for O
anticoagulation B-TREATMENT
and O
then O
when O
she O
was O
therapeutic O
on O
heparin B-TREATMENT
, O
we O
went O
ahead O
and O
started O
her O
on O
coumadin B-TREATMENT
and O
she O
is O
currently O
on O
coumadin B-TREATMENT
at O
2.5 O
mg O
q.h.s. O

Her O
INR O
is O
2.3 O
. O

We O
want O
her O
INR O
to O
remain O
between O
2 O
and O
3 O
. O

So O
if O
it O
goes O
much O
lower O
than O
2 O
, O
then O
we O
would O
consider O
increasing O
it O
to O
perhaps O
coumadin B-TREATMENT
2.5 O
and O
5 O
alternating O
every O
other O
night O
. O

However O
, O
we O
would O
leave O
it O
at O
2.5 O
for O
now O
. O

Other O
major O
issues O
- O
As O
a O
result O
of O
all O
the O
things O
happened O
and O
with O
her B-SYMPTOM
hyponatremia I-SYMPTOM
and O
also O
the B-SYMPTOM
other I-SYMPTOM
problems I-SYMPTOM
, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
was O
elevated B-SYMPTOM
also O
. O

We O
put O
her O
on O
nifedipine B-TREATMENT
IR I-TREATMENT
, O
SL O
and O
that O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
control O
her O
blood O
pressure O
which O
was O
in O
the O
200s O
in O
the O
systolic O
, O
so O
we O
had O
started O
her O
on O
atenolol B-TREATMENT
. O

So O
on O
discharge O
she O
is O
on O
atenolol B-TREATMENT
100 O
. O

If O
needed O
to O
you O
can O
give O
her O
some B-TREATMENT
nifedipine I-TREATMENT
SL I-TREATMENT
to O
decrease O
her O
blood O
pressure O
. O

The O
patient O
also O
has O
significant B-SYMPTOM
edema I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
both I-SYMPTOM
arms I-SYMPTOM
now O
and O
also O
some B-SYMPTOM
mild I-SYMPTOM
edema I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
lower I-SYMPTOM
extremities I-SYMPTOM
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
fluid B-TREATMENT
restriction I-TREATMENT
should O
help O
with O
that O
. O

She O
is O
also O
a B-SYMPTOM
little I-SYMPTOM
dry I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O

Prior O

, O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
gunshot I-SYMPTOM
wound I-SYMPTOM
was O
sutured O
close O
in O
the O

The O
patient O
was O
placed O
on O
suicide B-TREATMENT
precautions I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
was O
hydrated O
with O
an B-TREATMENT
infusion I-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
intravenous I-TREATMENT
fluid I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Psychiatry O
Service O
, O
who O
began O
a O
battery O
of O
testing O
, O
which O
continues O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
Consulting O
Psychiatrist O
recommended O
a O
minimum O
of O
2 B-TREATMENT
point I-TREATMENT
restraints I-TREATMENT
at O
all O
times O
, O
and O
recommended O
the O
patient O
be O
monitored O
by O
a O
sitter O
. O

Allowing O
the O
patient O
to O
ambulate O
was O
not O
recommended O
. O

From O
a O
medical O
standpoint O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
well O
. O

He O
was O
initially O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurological O
Intensive O

Unit O
where O
he O
was O
closely O
monitored O
during O
the O
first O
two O
days O
of O
his O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
chief O
obstacle O
was O
bringing O
his O
blood O
pressure O
under O
control O
and O
this O
was O
ultimately O
achieved O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
Captopril B-TREATMENT
and O
Nifedipine B-TREATMENT
. O

After O
his O
blood O
pressure O
had O
stabilized O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Ward O
. O

Close O
monitoring O
demonstrated O
his O
blood O
pressure O
to O
be O
stable O
and O
within O
an O
acceptable O
rang O
on O
his B-TREATMENT
dosage I-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
Psychiatry O
Service O
followed O
up O
extensively O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
and O
his O
Psychiatric O
progress O
is O
detailed O
in O
the O
Psychiatry O
transfer O
note O

By O
the O
7th O
hospital O
day O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
medically O
stable O

He O
had O
undergone O
full O
Psychiatric O
evaluation O
, O
and O
was O
prepared O
for O
transfer O
to O
a O
Psychiatric O
Hospital O
. O

Therefore O
, O
because O
of O
his O
need O
for O
intense B-TREATMENT

the O

is O
discharged O

The O

She O

on O
the O

She O
was O
on O
GI B-TREATMENT

precautions I-TREATMENT
at O
all O

She O

She O
was O
kept O
NPO B-TREATMENT
until O
January O

when O
she O
began O

feel O

. O

At O
that O
time O
clear B-TREATMENT

All O

She O
also O
began O
Nadolol B-TREATMENT
40 O
mg O
QD O
to O
reduce O
her B-SYMPTOM
portal I-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
GI O
consult O
team O
continued O
to O
follow O
her O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
to O
contact O
her O
physician O
at O
Va O
Sit O
Namar O
Healthcare O
and O
was O
unsuccessful O
. O

Therefore O
we O
decided O
to O
work O
up O
her O
cirrhosis B-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
was O
described O
as O
having O
_______ O
cirrhosis B-SYMPTOM
and O
we O
decided O
that O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
etiology O
. O

Her O
ferritin O
and O
iron O
studies O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
evidence O
of O
hemochromatosis B-SYMPTOM
and O
her O
hep O
serologies O
were O
all O
negative O
. O

She O
also O
had O
negative O
antimitochondrial O
antibody O
and O
she O
also O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
ceruloplasmin B-SYMPTOM
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
admission O
were O
also O
sent O
an O
alpha-1-antitrypsin O
, O
which O
was O
negative O
. O

She O
did O
very O
well O
over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
admission O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
further B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her O
hematocrit O
stayed O
stable O
at O
approximately O
32 O
. O

We O
also O
did O
an O
ultrasound O
guided O
paracentesis O
. O

The O
peritoneal O
fluid O
showed O
a O
glucose O
of O
244 O
, O
total O
protein O
0.8 O
and O
a O
albumin O
of O
0.5 O
, O
globulin O
0.3 O
, O
amylase O
16 O
, O
LDH O
of O
51 O
. O

The O
serum O
albumin O
gradient O
was O
1.8 O
consistent O
with O
portal B-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
cell O
count O
showed O
a O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
of O
160 O
with O
16% O
polys O
. O

She O
therefore O
_________ O
criteria O
for O
a B-SYMPTOM
spontaneous I-SYMPTOM
bacterial I-SYMPTOM
peritonitis I-SYMPTOM
. O

Her O
platelet O
count O
stayed O
persistently B-SYMPTOM
low I-SYMPTOM
and O
we O
decided O
that O
it O
might O
be O
due O
to O
Cimetidine B-TREATMENT
. O

Therefore O
we O
switched O
her O
Cimetidine B-TREATMENT
to O
Prilosec B-TREATMENT
. O

By O
the O
2th O
the O
patient O
was O
feeling O
very O
well O
and O
desired O
to O
transfer O
or O
discharge O
to O
home O
. O

She O
wanted O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
North O
Dakota O
. O

After O

the O

she O
was O
sent O

She O
was O
quite O

He O
had O
been O
started O
on O
Heparin B-TREATMENT
from O
the O
time O
of O
his O
admission O
. O

A O
computerized O

had O
showed O
multiple B-SYMPTOM

Because O
of O
his O
blood O

, O
dependence O
of O
his O
left O

extremities O
, O
the O
lower O
leg O
specifically O
, O
he O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
where O
he O
underwent O
hypertensive B-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
for O
several O
days O
. O

His O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
goal O
was O
initially O
170-190 O
, O
which O
he O
was O
able O
to O
achieve O
spontaneously O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
clear O
benefit O
at O
this O
level O
, O
and O
further B-SYMPTOM
deterioration I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM

, O
this O
goal O
was O
increased O
and O
Neo-Synephrine B-TREATMENT
was O
added O
to O
his O
regimen O
to O
achieve O
mean O
arterial O
pressures O
in O
the O
110-120 O
range O
. O

This O
strategy O
and O
its O
incumbent O
risks O
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
patient O
on O
Heparin B-TREATMENT
, O
were O
discussed O
at O
length O
with O
both O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
family O
, O
who O
were O
very O
clear O
in O
wanting O
to O
proceed O
with O
all O
possible O
efforts O
to O
save O
the O
use O
of O
his O
left O
leg O
. O

While O
in O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
his O
strength O
deteriorated O
from O
being O
able O
to O
hold O
his O
left O
leg O
off O
the O
bed O
up O
to O
several O
inches O
to O
loosing O
virtually O
all O

extremity O
strength O
, O
and O
having O
a O
2-3/5 O
power O
in O
his O
proximal O
left O

groups O
. O

He O
also O
, O
as O
Neo-Synephrinewas B-TREATMENT
tapered O
, O
developed O
mild B-SYMPTOM
sensory I-SYMPTOM

, O
in O

in I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM

although O
he O
at O
times O
, O
including O
near O
the O
end O
of O
his O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
gaze I-SYMPTOM
preference I-SYMPTOM
. O

In O
terms O
of O
exploring O
his O
visual O
space O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
look O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
elicit O
clear O
evidence O
for O
a B-SYMPTOM
field I-SYMPTOM
deficit I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
followed O
by O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
service O
, O
who O
assisted O
in O
the B-TREATMENT
management I-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
po I-TREATMENT
intake I-TREATMENT
which O
gradually O
improved O
, O
although O
he O
clearly O
had O
problems O
with O
manipulation O
of O
food O
in O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
would O
tend O
to O
accumulate O
a O
pouch O
of O
food O
in O
his O
left O
cheek O
. O

I O
should O
mention O
that O
his B-TREATMENT
blood I-TREATMENT
pressure I-TREATMENT
therapy I-TREATMENT
was O
at O
times O
limited O
by O
a B-SYMPTOM
severe I-SYMPTOM
headache I-SYMPTOM
, O
although O
he O
also O
had O
this O
off O
the B-TREATMENT
pressor I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
had O
several O
repeat O
imaging O
studies O
during O
his O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
which O
showed O
further B-SYMPTOM
demarcation I-SYMPTOM
, O
but O
not O
extension B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM
prior I-SYMPTOM
infarct I-SYMPTOM
, O
both O
on O
computerized O

and O
DWI O

. O

Additionally O
, O
he O
had O
a O
perfusion O
, O
diffusion O
MR O
study O
earlier O
on O
, O
which O
suggested O
the O
presence O
of O
viable B-SYMPTOM
penumbra I-SYMPTOM
, O
including O
the O
overlying O
cortex O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
regular O
neurology O
floor O
once O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
he O
was O
not O
receiving O
any O
significant O
benefit O
from O
hypertensive B-TREATMENT

At O
this O

HISTORY O
AND O
REASON O
FOR O
HOSPITALIZATION O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
79 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
an B-TREATMENT
ascending I-TREATMENT
aortic I-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
replacement I-TREATMENT
in O
1991 O
for O
aortic B-SYMPTOM
dissection I-SYMPTOM
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
patient O
's O
hospital O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
a B-SYMPTOM
sternal I-SYMPTOM
wound I-SYMPTOM
infection I-SYMPTOM
requiring O
a B-TREATMENT
sternal I-TREATMENT
debridement I-TREATMENT
and O
subsequent B-TREATMENT
abdominal I-TREATMENT
flap I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
continued O
by O
report O
on O
Dicloxacillin B-TREATMENT
for O
approximately O
one O
year O
following O
that B-TREATMENT
reconstructive I-TREATMENT
operation I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
apparently O
did O
well O
until O
June O
1998 O
when O
he O
noted O
a B-SYMPTOM
bulge I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM
sternal I-SYMPTOM
area I-SYMPTOM
. O

A B-SYMPTOM
ruptured I-SYMPTOM
aneurysm I-SYMPTOM
or O
pseudoaneurysm B-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
junction O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
and O
arch O
was O
diagnosed O
and O
this O
was O
subsequently O
repaired O
. O

The O
patient O
then O
had O
recurrent B-SYMPTOM
bleeding I-SYMPTOM
two O
weeks O
later O
which O
was O
once O
again O
repaired O
. O

However O
the B-SYMPTOM
same I-SYMPTOM
problem I-SYMPTOM
recurred O
for O
a O
third O
time O
and O
a O
computer O
tomogram O
scan O
at O
an O
outside O
hospital O
showed O
an B-SYMPTOM
anterior I-SYMPTOM
hematoma I-SYMPTOM
. O

By O
report O
the O
patient O
was O
at O
that O
time O
told O
that O
there O
was O
no O
more O
that O
could O
be O
done O
for O
him O
and O
was O
then O
apparently O
placed O
on O
comfort B-TREATMENT
measures I-TREATMENT
and O
pain B-TREATMENT
control I-TREATMENT
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
. O

However O
the O
patient O
was O
then O
subsequently O
transferred O
to O
Fairm O
of O
Ijordcompmac O
Hospital O
upon O
request O
of O
the O
family O
on O
8/24/98 O
for O
further O
evaluation O
and O
possible O
intervention B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Rhalt O
of O
Dentvailr. O
Medical O
Center O
. O

As O
the O
patient O
's O
early O
evaluation O
the O
patient O
underwent O
an O
aortogram O
which O
showed O
an B-TREATMENT
ascending I-TREATMENT
aortic I-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
with O
bulging B-SYMPTOM
flaps I-SYMPTOM
and O
a B-SYMPTOM
pseudoaneurysm I-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
anastomosis O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
and O
arch O
just O
below O
the O
great O
vessels O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
for O
a B-SYMPTOM
definite I-SYMPTOM
leak I-SYMPTOM
but O
there O
was O
evidence O
for O
gas B-SYMPTOM
bubbles I-SYMPTOM
in O
the O
anterior O
posterior O
distal O
ends O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
grafts I-TREATMENT
consistent O
with O
an B-SYMPTOM
infectious I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Service O
who O
upon O
culturing O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
sternal I-SYMPTOM
drainage I-SYMPTOM
switched O
the O
patient O
from O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
Unasyn I-TREATMENT
to O
Levofloxacin B-TREATMENT
for O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
Citrobacter B-SYMPTOM
and O
Diphtheroids B-SYMPTOM
in O
the O
wound O
cultures O
. O

Subsequent O
to O
starting O
this B-TREATMENT
antibiotic I-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
wound I-SYMPTOM
drainage I-SYMPTOM
appeared O
to O
subside O
. O

Given O
all O
the O
findings O
on O
the O
aortogram O
and O
the O
subsequent O
chest O
computer O
tomogram O
scan O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
the O
patient O
's O
only O
real O
surgical O
option O
for O
cure O
was O
a B-TREATMENT
risky I-TREATMENT
operation I-TREATMENT
that O
involved O
removal B-TREATMENT
and I-TREATMENT
replacement I-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
the I-TREATMENT
aortic I-TREATMENT
graft I-TREATMENT
probably O
with O
homograft B-TREATMENT
and O
long B-TREATMENT
term I-TREATMENT
antibiotic I-TREATMENT
coverage I-TREATMENT
as O
well O
as O
a B-TREATMENT
plastic I-TREATMENT
surgical I-TREATMENT
reconstructive I-TREATMENT
procedure I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
understood O
the O
risks O
and O
potential O
benefits O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
procedure I-TREATMENT
and O
was O
willing O
to O
proceed O
. O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
complained O
of O
no O

postoperative O
day O
the O
patient O
was O
awakened O
and O
weaned O
to O
extubate O
without O
significant B-SYMPTOM
difficulties I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
's O
subsequent O
postoperative O
course O
was O
characterized O
by O
persistent B-SYMPTOM
hypertension I-SYMPTOM
which O
required O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
continued O
to O

was O
becoming O
more O

as O
time O
went O
on O

as O
his O

. O

Subsequently O
on O

day O
no. O
8 O
in O
the O
Intensive O

the O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
ready O

the O
Cardiac O
Surgical O
Inpatient O
Service O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O

followed O

the O
Infectious O

Service O
who O
felt O
that O
the B-TREATMENT

needed O
to O
stay O
in O
as O
there O

the O

Given O
this O
finding O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O

would O
certainly O
need O
long B-TREATMENT

intravenous I-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
to O
include O
at O

six O
weeks O

placed O
on O

day O
no. O
9 O
without O
any B-SYMPTOM
difficulty I-SYMPTOM
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
stable O
on O
his B-TREATMENT
antihypertensive I-TREATMENT
regimen I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
was O
becoming O
more O
mobile O
and O
was O
taking O
a B-TREATMENT
high I-TREATMENT

high I-TREATMENT

which O
he O
tolerated O
well O
. O

He O
continued O
to O

otherwise O
very O
stable O
. O

On O
postoperative O
day O
no. O

the O

was O
noted O
to O
have O
fallen O

subsequently O

the O
PIP O
joint O
of O
his O
left O
middle O
finger O
. O

Subsequent O
hand O

obtained O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
fracture B-SYMPTOM
but O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Plastic O
Surgery O
Hand O
Service O
. O

The O
patient O
will O
benefit O
from O
splinting B-TREATMENT

the B-SYMPTOM
swelling I-SYMPTOM
subsided O
and O
subsequent B-TREATMENT
early I-TREATMENT

to O
prevent O
any B-SYMPTOM
rigidity I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
that I-SYMPTOM

The O
patient O
was O
also O
seen O
subsequently O
in O

Surgical O
Service O
who O
discontinued O
a O
number O
of O
the B-TREATMENT
patient I-TREATMENT

but O
they O
felt O
that O
others O
needed O
to O
stay O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
sent O
to O

. O

These B-TREATMENT
drains I-TREATMENT

then O
be O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
continued O
to O
be O
hemodynamically O
stable O
making O
good O

As O
a O
matter O
of O

She O
was O
later O
continued O
on O
Ceftazidine B-TREATMENT
and O
Clindamycin B-TREATMENT
for O
possible O
gram B-SYMPTOM
negative I-SYMPTOM
infection I-SYMPTOM
and O
also O
for O
possible O
post B-SYMPTOM
obstructive I-SYMPTOM
picture I-SYMPTOM
that O
she O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
for O
given O
her O
pulmonary O
anatomy O
. O

As O
the O
Hubbard O
Regional O
Hospital O
hospital O
course O
went O
on O
the O
patient O
's O
respiratory O
did O
not O
show O
mild O
improvement O
on O
the B-TREATMENT
ventilator I-TREATMENT
. O

She O
was O
able O
to O
oxygenate O
originally O
. O

Unfortunately O
her O
mental O
status O
failed O
to O
improve O
despite O
having O
been O
off O
all B-TREATMENT
sedative I-TREATMENT
medications I-TREATMENT
for O
several O
days O
. O

Later O
in O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
family O
meetings O
took O
place O
and O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
overall O
poor O
prognosis O
with O
decreased B-SYMPTOM
mental I-SYMPTOM
status I-SYMPTOM
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
become O
CMO B-TREATMENT
. O

Subsequently O
she O
was O
extubated O
on O
06-28 O
. O

The O
patient O
continues O
to O
actually O
ventilate O
well O
off O
of O
the O
respiratory O

However O
, O
she O
is O
CMO B-TREATMENT
and O
will O
not O
be O
intubated O
for O
respiratory B-SYMPTOM
distress I-SYMPTOM
. O

2. O
Cardiovascular O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
initially O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
thought O
to O
be O
exhibiting O
septic B-SYMPTOM
physiology I-SYMPTOM
, O
respiratory B-SYMPTOM
distress I-SYMPTOM
and O
hypotensive B-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
required O
aggressive B-TREATMENT
intravenous I-TREATMENT
fluids I-TREATMENT
and O
later O
required O
pressor B-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
with O
neo-synephrine B-TREATMENT
. O

Later O
during O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
she O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
somewhat B-SYMPTOM
overloaded I-SYMPTOM
and O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
fluids I-TREATMENT
were O
cut O
back O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
difficult O
weaning O
her O
off O
of O
neo-synephrine B-TREATMENT
. O

She O
was O
also O
given O
stress B-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
steroids I-TREATMENT
. O

Later O
in O
her O
hospital O
course O
she O
also O
had O
an O
echocardiogram O
for O
question O
of O
new O
ECG O
findings O
in O
her O
inferior O
leads O
. O

Her O
echocardiogram O
, O
however O
, O
was O
essentially O
normal O
with O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
55% O
without O
any B-SYMPTOM
gross I-SYMPTOM
wall I-SYMPTOM
motion I-SYMPTOM
abnormalities I-SYMPTOM
or O
valvular B-SYMPTOM
pathology I-SYMPTOM
. O

As O
mentioned O
above O
the O
patient O
's O
hemodynamic O
status O
was O
tenuous B-SYMPTOM
throughout O
her O
hospital O
course O
as O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
wean O
the O
patient O
off O
of O
neo-synephrine B-TREATMENT
. O

By O
06-28 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
off O
of O
neo-synephrine B-TREATMENT
, O
but O
at O
this O
time O
as O
mentioned O
above O
the O
patient O
was O
deemed O
to O
be O
CMO B-TREATMENT
per O
discussion O
with O
physicians O
and O
her O
husband O
/ O
health O

a O
history O
of O
known B-SYMPTOM
malignancy I-SYMPTOM
and O
also O
a O
history O
of O
pulmonary B-SYMPTOM
embolisms I-SYMPTOM
from O
2012-04-23 O
. O

Earlier O
in O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
the O
team O
was O
concerned O
about O
possible O
pulmonary B-SYMPTOM
embolisms I-SYMPTOM
as O
a O
possible O
source O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
's I-SYMPTOM
respiratory I-SYMPTOM
decompensation I-SYMPTOM
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
also O
had O
brain B-SYMPTOM
metastasis I-SYMPTOM
and O
at O
this O
point O
anticoagulation B-TREATMENT
was O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
contraindication O
given O
risk O
for O
hemorrhage B-SYMPTOM
into O
these B-SYMPTOM
tumors I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
did O
have O
lower O
extremity O
doppler O
ultrasounds O
, O
which O
were O
negative O
. O

4. O
Infectious O
disease O
: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
patient O
initially O
hypotension B-SYMPTOM
, O
febrile B-SYMPTOM
and O
in O
respiratory B-SYMPTOM
distress I-SYMPTOM
presumed O
to O
be O
septic B-SYMPTOM
source I-SYMPTOM
likely O
pulmonary O
. O

Initially O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
broad B-TREATMENT
spectrum I-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
including O
Vancomycin B-TREATMENT
, O
Ceptaz B-TREATMENT
, O
Levaquin B-TREATMENT
, O
Clindamycin B-TREATMENT
and O
_________. O

All O
of O
her O
cultures O
are O
negative O
to O
date O
. O

She O
was O
negative O
for O
PCP B-SYMPTOM
and O
subsequently O
_____________ O
was O
continued O
and O
Clindamycin B-TREATMENT
was O
changed O
for O
anaerobic B-TREATMENT
coverage I-TREATMENT
. O

In O
addition O
her B-TREATMENT
Vancomycin I-TREATMENT
and O
Levaquin B-TREATMENT
were O
also O
discontinued O
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
afebrile B-SYMPTOM
during O
the O
majority O
of O
her O
hospital O
course O
. O

By O
virtue O
of O
discussions O
on O
06-28 O
the O
patient O
was O
deemed O
to O
be O
CMO B-TREATMENT
and O
all B-TREATMENT
antibiotics I-TREATMENT
were O
withdrawn O
at O
this O
point O
. O

5. O
Gastroenterology O
: O

The O
patient O
had O
an O
abdominal O
CT O
earlier O
in O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
, O
which O
was O
essentially O
negative O
for O
an B-SYMPTOM
intraabdominal I-SYMPTOM
pathology I-SYMPTOM
. O

She O
was O
initially O
supported O
with O
tube B-TREATMENT
feeds I-TREATMENT
during O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
, O
but O
at O
this O
point O
the O
patient O
is O
CMO B-TREATMENT
and O
tube B-TREATMENT
feeds I-TREATMENT
have O
been O
subsequently O
discontinued O
. O

DISPOSITION O
: O

The O
patient O

attending O
physician O
was O
in O
constant O
communication O
with O
the O
patient O

meaningful O
improvement O
, O
continued O
discussions O
were O
had O
with O
the O
family O
about O

that O
the O
patient O
had O
shown O
minimal O
improvement O
and O
minimal O
evidence O

point O
for O
the O
patient O
to O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

1. O
HYPOGLYCEMIA B-SYMPTOM
: O

The O
patient O
had O
been O
initially O
very B-SYMPTOM
hypoglycemic I-SYMPTOM
on O
admission O
secondary O
to O
overdosing B-SYMPTOM
on I-SYMPTOM
insulin I-SYMPTOM
; O
however O
, O
with O
glucose B-TREATMENT
repletion I-TREATMENT
both O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
and O
in O
the O
ICU O
, O
this O
resolved O
and O
the O
patient O
also O
began O
to O
eat O
. O

We O
checked O
fingerstick O
glucoses O
q.i.d. O
and O
at O
3:00 O
a.m. O

His O
glucose O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
discharge O
was O
about O
60 O
so O
we O
opted O
to O
decrease O
his B-TREATMENT
p.m. I-TREATMENT
NPH I-TREATMENT
dose I-TREATMENT
slightly O
for O
discharge O
and O
continue O
covering O
him O
with O
sliding B-TREATMENT
scale I-TREATMENT
insulin I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
should O
also O
continue O
having O
a O
snack O
at O
midnight O
if O
able O
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
he O
required O
a O
much O
greater O
amount O
of O
insulin B-TREATMENT
as O
an O
outpatient O
due O
to O
poor B-SYMPTOM
compliance I-SYMPTOM
with O
Richard B-TREATMENT
Natalie I-TREATMENT
diet I-TREATMENT
. O

2. O
ALCOHOL O
ABUSE O
: O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
patient O
continues O
to O
drink O
more O
than O
he O
admits O
. O

He O
did O
have O
past O
alcoholism O
consisting O
of O
a O
half O
a O
pint O
of O
brandy O
per O
day O
for O
three O
years O
but O
supposedly O
had O
quit O
in O
2009-09-03 O
. O

He O
had O
been O
on O
a B-TREATMENT
diazepam I-TREATMENT
CIWA I-TREATMENT
scale I-TREATMENT
prophylaxis I-TREATMENT
against O
DT B-SYMPTOM
s; I-SYMPTOM
however O
, O
he O
had O
a O
very O
low O
CIWA O
scale O
during O
his O
entire O
admission O
and O
did O
not O
need O
any B-TREATMENT
benzodiazepines I-TREATMENT
. O

This O
alcohol O
abuse O
may O
be O
further O
addressed O
as O
an O
inpatient O
on O
the O
Psychiatry O
Quincy O
Medical O
Center O
. O

We O
had O
also O
requested O
a O
Social O
Work O
consult O
regarding O
this O
. O

3. O
DEPRESSION B-SYMPTOM
vs. O
Borderline B-SYMPTOM
personality I-SYMPTOM
disorder I-SYMPTOM
: O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
several O
admissions O
in O
the O
past O
for O
attempted B-SYMPTOM
suicide I-SYMPTOM
with O
overdose B-SYMPTOM
of O
his B-TREATMENT
insulin I-TREATMENT
and O
though O
he O
denied O
at O
this O
time O
attempting O
to O
end O
his O
life O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
social O
situation O
of O
increased B-SYMPTOM
stressors I-SYMPTOM
corresponding O
to O
this O
time O
suggest O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
truth O
. O

He O
received O
a O
one-to-one B-TREATMENT
sitter I-TREATMENT
during O
his O
admission O
and O
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
Psychiatry O
HealthSouth O
New O
England O
Rehab O
Hospital O
to O
ensure O
the O
patient O
's O
safety O
and O
initiate O
further B-TREATMENT
antidepressant I-TREATMENT
treatment I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
will O
need O
close O
follow-up O
regarding O
his B-SYMPTOM
depression I-SYMPTOM
as O
an O
outpatient O
, O
although O
apparently O
this O
has O
been O
set O
up O
for O
him O
in O
the O
past O
and O
he O
had O
not O
followed O
through O
. O

4. O
HISTORY O
OF O
HIGH B-SYMPTOM
BLOOD I-SYMPTOM
PRESSURE I-SYMPTOM
: O

His O
blood O
pressure O
was O
fairly O
low O
with O
a O
maximum O
of O
130s O
systolic O
during O
his O
admission O
, O
thus O
we O
did O
not O
continue O
his B-TREATMENT
lisinopril I-TREATMENT
which O
he O
had O
been O
on O
in O
the O
past O
. O

: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O

He O
was O

he O
had O
on O

Because O
his O

he O
was O
transfused O
with O
radiated B-TREATMENT
Leuco I-TREATMENT
four O
units O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
good O
bump O
in O
his O
hematocrit O
, O
more O
than O
expected O
from O
22 O
to O
high O
20 O
&apos;s O
range O
next O
day O
after O
3 O
1/2 O
units O
, O
but O
later O
that O
evening O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
drop I-SYMPTOM
in O
his O
hematocrit O
so O
was O
given O
4 O
more O
1/2 O

He O
again O
did O
not O
bump O

sufficiently O
and O
remained O
in O
the O
high O
20 O
&apos;s O
after O
a O
total O
of O
4 O

, O
so O
he O
was O

. O

His O

and O
felt O

It O
is O
unclear O
why O
the O

did O
not O
bump O

more O
but O
he O
did O
not O
appear O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
25 O
year O
old O
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
a B-SYMPTOM
gunshot I-SYMPTOM
wound I-SYMPTOM
many O
years O
ago O
and O
has O
had O
multiple B-TREATMENT
surgical I-TREATMENT
procedures I-TREATMENT
since O
then O
. O

Most O
recently O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
an O
outside O
hospital O
with O
a B-SYMPTOM
drug I-SYMPTOM
overdose I-SYMPTOM
in O
adult B-SYMPTOM
respiratory I-SYMPTOM
distress I-SYMPTOM
syndrome I-SYMPTOM
and O
ultimately O
found O
to O
have O
Candidal B-SYMPTOM
pericarditis I-SYMPTOM
which O
eventually O
led O
to O
constrictive B-SYMPTOM
pericarditis I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
had O
a B-TREATMENT
pericardial I-TREATMENT
window I-TREATMENT
. O

He O
had O
a O
barium O
swallow O
and O
endoscopy O
and O
was O
said O
not O
to O
have O
gastric B-SYMPTOM
or I-SYMPTOM
pericardial I-SYMPTOM
ulcer I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
had O
previous B-TREATMENT
substernal I-TREATMENT
gastric I-TREATMENT
bypass I-TREATMENT
because O
of O
an B-SYMPTOM
interruption I-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
his I-SYMPTOM
esophagus I-SYMPTOM
at O
the O
time O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
gunshot I-SYMPTOM
wound I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
had O
been O
noted O
to O
have O
an B-SYMPTOM
ulcer I-SYMPTOM
and O
ultimately O
when O
he O
stabilized O
it O
was O
our O
feeling O
that O
he O
most O
likely O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
gastric I-SYMPTOM
pericardial I-SYMPTOM
ulcer I-SYMPTOM
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
here O
for O
further B-TREATMENT
management I-TREATMENT
. O

We O
discussed O
the O
risks O
with O
his O
family O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
high O
risk O
in O
very B-SYMPTOM
poor I-SYMPTOM
condition I-SYMPTOM
and O
a O
cachectic O
malnourished O
edematous O
individuals O
who O
have O
very B-SYMPTOM
high I-SYMPTOM
venous I-SYMPTOM
pressures I-SYMPTOM
and O
shortness B-SYMPTOM
of I-SYMPTOM
breath I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
family O
understood O
that O
this O
was O
a B-TREATMENT
life I-TREATMENT
saving I-TREATMENT
procedure I-TREATMENT
and O
only O
carried O
with O
it O
approximately O
50% O

of O
success O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O

was O
taken O
to O
the O

noted O
initially O
to O
have O
a O
pulmonary O

with O
a O
pulmonary O

in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
LAD I-SYMPTOM
. O

His O
left O
ventricle O
ejection O
showed O
diffuse B-SYMPTOM
hypokinesis I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
his O
wife O
, O
Sligh O
. O

She O
noted O
that O
he O
was O
actively O
working O
full O
time O
and O
was O
a O
sales O
representative O
at O
the O
Leigh O
and O
lives O
at O
home O
with O
her O
and O
his O
daughter O
, O
age O
18 O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
evidence O
of O
congestive B-SYMPTOM
heart I-SYMPTOM
failure I-SYMPTOM
and O
the B-SYMPTOM
critical I-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
main I-SYMPTOM
lesion I-SYMPTOM
, O
he O
should O
be O
admitted O
for O

. O

He O
developed O
epigastric B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
on O
07/31 O
which O
previously O
had O
been O
ignored O
but O
in O
retrospect O
was O
probably O
his B-SYMPTOM
anginal I-SYMPTOM
equivalent I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
also O
had O
multifocal B-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
ectopy I-SYMPTOM
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
had O
some B-SYMPTOM
further I-SYMPTOM
anterolateral I-SYMPTOM
ST I-SYMPTOM
segment I-SYMPTOM
changes I-SYMPTOM
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
did O
have O
unstable B-SYMPTOM
angina I-SYMPTOM
with O
his B-SYMPTOM
critical I-SYMPTOM
coronary I-SYMPTOM
anatomy I-SYMPTOM

A B-SYMPTOM
paraphimosis I-SYMPTOM
was O
noted O
and O
treated O
by O
Dr. O
Ryna O
Jescdrig O
. O

After O
surgery B-TREATMENT
he O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
ongoing I-SYMPTOM
sinus I-SYMPTOM
tachycardia I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
be O
rapidly O
weaned O
and O
extubated O
. O

He O
had O
good O
hemodynamics O
. O

He O
had O
occasional B-SYMPTOM
atrial I-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
premature I-SYMPTOM
beats I-SYMPTOM
. O

His B-TREATMENT
intra-aortic I-TREATMENT
balloon I-TREATMENT

was O
weaned O
the O
following O
day O
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
out O
of O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Nutrition O
Service O
, O
who O
followed O
him O
for O
dietary O
management O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
diabetes I-SYMPTOM

. O

On O
08/05 O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
his O
platelet O
count O
had O
fallen O
from O
171,000 O
to O
54,000 O
; O
this O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
intravenous B-TREATMENT
Heparin I-TREATMENT
and O
indeed O
, O
when O
Heparin B-TREATMENT
was O
discontinued O
, O
since O
it O
had O
been O
restarted O
after O
surgery O
, O
his O
platelet O
count O
rebounded O
to O
normal O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
does O
have O
a B-SYMPTOM
thrombocytopenic I-SYMPTOM
reaction I-SYMPTOM
to O
Heparin B-TREATMENT
. O

He O
remained O
in O
normal O
sinus O

He O
did O
have O
runs O
of O
nonsustained B-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
tachycardia I-SYMPTOM
, O
which O
were O
clinically O
stable O
. O

He O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
right I-SYMPTOM
bundle I-SYMPTOM
branch I-SYMPTOM
block I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
is O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
future O
events O
because O
of O
his B-SYMPTOM
low I-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM

, O
but O
he O

clinically O
stable O
on O
ACE B-TREATMENT

Therefore O
he O
was O
able O

He O
understands O
that O
he O
does O
have O
significant B-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM

requires O

His O
postoperative O

was O
complicated O
by O

, O
he O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
any B-SYMPTOM

nor O
did O
he O
have O
any O

of O
intubation B-TREATMENT
prior O
to O
the O
operation B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
status O
of O
Mr. O
Nina O
pulmonary O
system O
necessitated O
a B-TREATMENT
prolonged I-TREATMENT
postoperative I-TREATMENT
intubation I-TREATMENT
. O

After O
a O
very O
slow O
wean O
from O
ventilatory B-TREATMENT
support I-TREATMENT
, O
Mr. O
Knueppel O
was O
successfully O
extubated O

. O

He O
continued O
to O
be O
very O
tenuous O
from O
a O

and O
required O
frequent B-TREATMENT
chest I-TREATMENT

. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Mr. O

Such O
a O

it O
very O
difficult O

was O
noted O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
continued O
on O

The O

the O

, O
GI O
Interventional O
Radiology O
performed O
drainage B-TREATMENT
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
peripancreatic I-SYMPTOM
fluid I-SYMPTOM
collection I-SYMPTOM
. O

Approximately O
one O
liter O
of O
brownish B-SYMPTOM
fluid I-SYMPTOM
was O
obtained O
and O
sent O
for O
culture O
. O

The B-TREATMENT
drainage I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
was O
left O
in O
a B-SYMPTOM
pseudocyst I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Cardiology O
. O

A O
Persantine O
Thallium O
study O
demonstrated O
a B-SYMPTOM
large I-SYMPTOM
infarct I-SYMPTOM
, O
involving O
the O
posteroseptal O
, O
anteroseptal O
areas O
. O

Left B-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
aneurysm I-SYMPTOM
was O
also O
noted O
; O
however O
, O
no O
ischemia B-SYMPTOM
was O
seen O
. O

An O
echocardiogram O
was O
done O
. O

The O
echocardiogram O
showed O
terrible B-SYMPTOM
left I-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
function I-SYMPTOM
, O
with O
left B-SYMPTOM
ventricular I-SYMPTOM
aneurysm I-SYMPTOM
. O

The O
right O
ventricle O
appeared O
to O
be O
acceptable O
. O

The B-TREATMENT
percutaneous I-TREATMENT
drainage I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
continued O
to O
have O
high O
output O
. O

The O
fluid O
was O
sent O
for O
amylase O
, O
which O
came O
back O
53,230 O
. O

On O
4/28/95 O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
new O
onset O
of O
abdominal B-SYMPTOM
pain I-SYMPTOM
. O

His O
white O
count O
had O
bumped O
from O
8.3 O
on O
admission O
to O
18.5 O
, O
on O
4/27 O
. O

A O
computerized O

scan O
of O
the O
abdomen O
was O
performed O
. O

Approximately O
100 O
cc.&apos;s O
of O
thick B-SYMPTOM
brownish I-SYMPTOM
material I-SYMPTOM
was O
aspirated O
through O
the B-TREATMENT
indwelling I-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
. O

The O
computerized O

scan O
showed O
the B-TREATMENT
catheter I-TREATMENT
tip I-TREATMENT
in O
good O
position O
. O

Because O
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
patient I-SYMPTOM
&apos;s I-SYMPTOM
deteriorating I-SYMPTOM
state I-SYMPTOM
, O
the O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
4/28/95 O
. O

An O
exploratory O
laparotomy O
was O
performed O
. O

The O
splenic O
flexure O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
purulent I-SYMPTOM
exudative I-SYMPTOM
process I-SYMPTOM
along I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
antimesenteric I-SYMPTOM
surface I-SYMPTOM
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
splenic O
flexure O
and O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
descending O
colon O
were O
resected B-TREATMENT
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
a B-TREATMENT
left I-TREATMENT
colectomy I-TREATMENT
with O
end B-TREATMENT
transverse I-TREATMENT
colostomy I-TREATMENT
, O
and O
oversewing B-TREATMENT
of I-TREATMENT
the I-TREATMENT
descending I-TREATMENT
colon I-TREATMENT
. O

Drainage B-TREATMENT
of O
the B-SYMPTOM
pancreatic I-SYMPTOM
necrosis I-SYMPTOM
was O
also O
done O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the B-TREATMENT
procedure I-TREATMENT
fairly O
well O
, O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

In O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
prolonged O
course O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
extubated O
on O
postoperative O
day O
#2 O
, O
but O
remained O
pressor-dependent B-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
remained O
on O
imipenem B-TREATMENT
, O
and O
Vancomycin B-TREATMENT
was O
also O
started O
. O

Thereafter O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a B-SYMPTOM
long I-SYMPTOM
and I-SYMPTOM
complicated I-SYMPTOM
postoperative I-SYMPTOM
course I-SYMPTOM
. O

He O
was O
eventually O
transferred O

. O

These O
resolved O
without O
incident O
. O

He O
also O
had O
repeated B-SYMPTOM
temperature I-SYMPTOM
spikes I-SYMPTOM
. O

After O
repeated O
work O
ups O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
these O
were O
probably O
due O
to O
remaining B-SYMPTOM
infection I-SYMPTOM
in I-SYMPTOM
the I-SYMPTOM
peripancreatic I-SYMPTOM
area I-SYMPTOM
. O

His B-TREATMENT

He O
did O
have O
problems B-SYMPTOM
with O
po O

. O

He O
had O
repeated O
bouts O
of O
small-volume B-SYMPTOM
emesis I-SYMPTOM
that O
may O
have O
been O
secondary O
to O

. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
anti-emetics B-TREATMENT
, O
most O
recently O
Granisetron B-TREATMENT
, O
with O
only O
mild O

throughout O
his O
hospital O
course O
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
June O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
Mr. O

to O
eradicate O
his B-SYMPTOM
intra-abdominal I-SYMPTOM
